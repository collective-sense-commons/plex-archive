As futurist Bob Johansen reminds us, itâ€™s actually easier to look out ten or 20 years than one or two years because we can clear all the clutter off the horizon and focus on the bigger trends to get a sense of where we want to be. Weâ€™re not seeking prognostications, rather weâ€™re interested in what is guiding your work, what movements youâ€™re part of that are pursuing similar aims and what you are seeing that gives you hope and strengthens your conviction that, despite the daily barrage of bad news, the world is waking up and moving in the right direction.</p><p>If that sounds like the kind of conversation youâ€™d like to have, ping <strong>Ken Homer</strong> - <a href="mailto:kenhomer@sonic.net">kenhomer@sonic.net</a> - to arrange a date for an interview. We meet on Fridays at 10AM Pacific time for one hour - the interview portion is about 45 mins. The format is informal, the people on the call, friendly and curious, and the conversations are always lively. Weâ€™d love to talk with you. Not sure if itâ€™s right for you? Take a look at our website and youtube channel to get a flavor for what weâ€™re up to and who weâ€™re talking with: <a href="https://www.society2045.org/">https://www.society2045.org</a></p><h2 id="living-between-worlds"><strong>Living Between Worlds</strong></h2><p>Gil's "<strong>Living Between Worlds</strong>" webinar series resumes Wednesday, February 16th 12-1:30pm PT (and every third Wednesday thereafter).

Page News (recent changes) work has been going slower than expected because of various underlying technical frictions. We have high hopes for a great new idea, <strong>pier2pier</strong>, to deploy various MW utilities via a single Docker container, more news on that to come.</p><p>Speaking of knowledge work, the places and the praxis, Bill offers a haiku.</p><blockquote>I found my old notes.<br>But the topics didn't match<br>My ontologies.</blockquote><h2 id="black-history-month"><strong>Black History Month</strong></h2><p>In honor of Black History Month, a couple of links:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/01/1075623826/why-is-february-black-history-month">The story behind Black History Month â€” and why it's celebrated in February</a> (NPR, 2022-02-01)</li><li><a href="https://daily.jstor.org/alan-emtage-first-internet-search-engine/">Alan Emtage, the Black Technologist Who Invented ARCHIE, the First Internet Search Engine</a> (JSTOR, Alexandra Samuel, 2017-02-21)</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Lawson_(engineer)">Jerry Lawson, the Father of the Video Game Cartridge</a> (Wikipedia)</li></ul><p>Your intrepid editor used ARCHIE back in the day; and worked on an early home video game console that was based on cartridges, the Intellivision.
