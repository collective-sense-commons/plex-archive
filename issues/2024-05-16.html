The course of learning I have been undertaking — my last decade of study — had no title or formality to mark its passage; no announcement, no speech, and certainly no diploma. But something about the feeling of this moment echoes that sunny day, where we all sat on folding chairs, sweating through the armpits of our Sunday-best, watching kid after kid walk across a stage, diploma in held tightly in one hand, empty promises of the establishment in the other.</p><p>As we crossed that stage, we were symbolically leaving behind the stability of what was Known to step forward&nbsp;into the real and rumbling world. They had told us for years that what we were learning would help us in that “real world”, that&nbsp;those<em>&nbsp;</em>were the skills needed to get by, to succeed, to thrive.</p><p>Maintaining a firm grasp on those empty words felt like holding on to fistfuls of dried spaghetti, snapping to bits whenever I would clench too tightly, pieces skittering over the tile of my young adulthood. I never even tried to pick up them up; I just kept going.</p><p>We know what happens next: kids everywhere advance into the real world with diplomas and handfuls of spaghetti. Some kids make it to the next graduation stage; some even have spaghetti left over. Some get by, some succeed, and the ones that thrive build their lives upon the shinier surfaces of society. Some self-destruct.</p><p>And then, there are the others: kids armed with spaghetti who get thrown cinderblocks, and have no choice but to find something else to hold onto. Some find hands; others just find holes.</p><p>What occurred to me today was that the post-graduation initiation doesn’t really ever end. Over a lifetime, we are handed new fistfuls of things that fill the void of Known; we find comfort in their defined edges, how heavy and solid and real they feel in our palms. We squeeze them for solace when we clench. We get thrown cinderblocks. The Known crumbles in our hand, and we find new Knowns.</p><p>Sometimes, in those blessed, cinderblock-free years, we clench until the comfort of the rigid edges of Known turns into an ache, and that ache, the cage that insulates us from the next step, the next solution, the next emergent invitation into the very next-ness of Life, individually and collectively.</p><p>Some spend everything trying to ignore the ache.<br><br>As long as our frameworks and systems are static, humankind will inexorably flatten the dynamic, flog the living, and anesthetize the emergent processes that propel life forward, so that they might be shoved head-first into static frameworks and systems.</p><p>I fear that – as long as we proceed in this way – we will continue to be shown that the Living cannot be contained within the tidy confines of Known and Accounted For, Quantified and Static.</p><p>The Living will never stop bursting through our attempts to contain it, the way tree roots buckle massive slabs of concrete, compromising cautiously-planned foundations. The Living will continue to flummox the scientists that walked across the most prestigious stages, and all the while, kids and families, communities and countries will fall between the cracks of their ignorance. And still, in our hubris and our fear, we will try to contain.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, the stage I cross feels like it may not be one of establishment, but of paradigm. This time, I’ll graduate, and what I hold in my hand is the paradox of our time: eternal, fixed, ever-changing, immutable — the certainty of the Unknown.&nbsp;</p><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/05/wood-23.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="960" height="1280" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/wood-23.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/05/wood-23.jpg 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">charles blass</span></figcaption></figure><hr><h2 id="%E2%80%9Cgpt-4oh%E2%80%9D-or-%E2%80%9C4-oh-no%E2%80%9D">“GPT-4oh!” or “4-oh, no!” ?</h2><p>by <strong>George Pór</strong></p><p>I have not been as excited about a piece of software’s potential for releasing vast volumes of human and social creativity since the first MacOS appeared 40 years ago! Back then, in the early heydays of the Mac, it touched a few thousand Mac aficionados. Today, the <strong>4o</strong> craze is spreading among 100+ million of us.&nbsp;</p><p>Who wouldn’t want to talk with an AI who can laugh at itself when embarrassed, sing something if you ask it, or even suggest slowing down your breathing when you panic? I bet lots of people will come for&nbsp; the fun of it, then discover myriads of uses for increasing their efficiency at various tasks.</p><p>Like any new tech, <strong>40</strong> will also have its share of detractors. I’ve just read it on Reddit,“Why is OpenAI providing their most powerful (publicly available) model for free? Won't that make it where people don't need to subscribe? What are they getting out of it? The reason they are providing it for free is that ‘Open’ AI is a big data corporation whose most valuable asset is the private data they have gathered from users.” That may be true, <em>and</em> I think the social benefits may outweigh the harm caused by my anonymized interactions with an AI being used for training its next generation.</p><p>The social benefit I‘m most interested in is GPT-4o’s potential, in the hands of motivated citizens, to help remove barriers to large-scale system change by powering up transformational initiatives. For example, imagine:</p><ul><li>a Wisdom Guide as a Non-Playing Character (NPC) in a discovery game, such as the <a href="https://medium.com/@technoshaman/three-mountains-the-synopsis-b2bad757bba1">Three Mountains</a>, where the players are discovering their next-stage version of themselves, and the NPC does not only ask wise questions as today’s <a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-izboiDia6-socrates-method">Socratic AIs</a> do but also, provide context-specific challenges to help the players grow into their fuller potential</li><li>your 4o-based and well-trained facilitator of (virtual or face-to-face) meeting on the fly summarizing the emergent consensus <em>and</em> the dissenting voices of democratic deliberations of a national citizen assembly on issues that matter to them, and instantaneously translating the meeting harvest to the languages of the citizen assemblies gathering around the same problems in other nations, thus eliminating language barriers to bottom-up planetary governance of the commons (caveat: that will also be used for planetary spread of disinformation by bad actors!)</li><li>a variation of the above not based on citizen assemblies but on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_community">epistemic communities</a></li></ul><p>In the coming months and years, change artists who intend to map and move the edge of evolutionary emergence enabled by the coming waves of human-AI co-creativity will get overwhelmed by the variety and velocity of societal AInnovation. That’s when they may discover the need for wisdom-focused Collaborative Hybrid Intelligence (CHI) of networked human teams working in symbiotic tandem with teams of AI agents.<br><br>Suppose CHI is the predecessor and sensing and meaning-making organ of some emergent, benevolent (planetary) superorganisms. What practical applications can YOU imagine building on top of GPT-4o (and “below”), which would help the superorganism wake up sooner?</p><p>Are there too many unknown concepts and open questions in my musings? Which would you like to hear more about in subsequent installments? They are not poetic questions; they are the ones our team is pondering.

Why are so many driven to transform our world? What deep-seated motivations guide their actions? These questions were at the core of our series, leading us to engage with nearly 40 thinkers and doers who are reshaping the very fabric of society.</p><p>Through our interviews, a compelling narrative unfolded: most of our guests are propelled not by external rewards or ideological dogma but by an intrinsic calling. This discovery was both startling and enlightening. The very nature within them, a heartfelt drive, is steering their journey towards new ways of being and doing. As we delved deeper, patterns emerged, surprisingly consistent across diverse fields and philosophies. These patterns were not enforced or strategically adopted; they were the natural manifestation of our interviewees' inner drives.</p><p>These emergent patterns testify to a shared human essence that seeks more than success—they reveal a collective aspiration for transformation driven by authenticity and a profound connection to life’s rhythms. This introduction sets the stage for exploring how these innate motivations are not only inspiring individual actions but also weaving a new societal fabric, poised to redefine the contours of our collective future.</p><h2 id="emergence-of-eight-transformative-patterns">Emergence of Eight Transformative Patterns</h2><p>Our journey through the Society 2045 podcast has identified eight transformational patterns, each symbolizing a shift from traditional paradigms to dynamic, interconnected systems. These patterns, revealed in part through our AI-assisted analysis, illustrate the collective yearning for a society that mirrors the organic complexity of life itself:</p><ol><li><strong>From Rigid Systems to Organic Rhythms of Life</strong></li></ol><p>Traditional societal systems impose rigid structures that demand conformity and uniformity, leading to stress and inefficiency as individuals struggle to adapt to one-size-fits-all models that rarely account for human diversity and the complexities of life.</p><ul><li>The move towards organic rhythms of life signifies a transition to systems that are fluid, adaptable, and aligned with the natural flow of life's processes. This approach allows for systems that dynamically adjust and evolve in response to human needs and environmental changes.</li><li>J. Kim Wright, through her pioneering work in transforming legal systems, exemplifies this shift by advocating for approaches that prioritize healing, mediation, and reconciliation over punitive measures, reflecting the organic processes of restoration found in nature.</li></ul><ol start="2"><li><strong>From Linear Story Progression to the Intricate Web of Nature</strong></li></ol><p>Societal narratives have long been dominated by linear progressions, which simplify complex life stories into straightforward, predictable pathways that often overlook the rich interdependencies and the chaotic, non-linear nature of real-world systems.</p><ul><li>Recognizing life as an intricate web reflects an understanding of the world as a dynamic network of interrelations, akin to ecological systems where diverse entities interact in complex and often unpredictable ways.</li><li>Jose Leal and Alicia Castillo Holley bring this pattern to life through their discussions on societal movements and creative ecosystems, illustrating how deeply intertwined and mutually influential our actions and life paths can be.</li></ul><ol start="3"><li><strong>From Impersonality of Transactions to Depth of Relationships</strong></li></ol><p>Modern economic and social interactions prioritize efficiency and profit over personal connection, leading to a transactional culture where relationships are secondary to outcomes.</p><ul><li>Shifting focus towards the depth of relationships means valuing personal connections and emotional investments as central to all interactions, fostering a culture where trust and mutual respect drive economic and social exchanges.</li><li>Alicia Castillo Holley’s investment strategies emphasize emotional returns, and Kimberly Wiefling’s resource-sharing initiatives champion a community-first approach, enhancing the relational fabric of business practices.</li></ul><ol start="4"><li><strong>From Exclusivity of Proprietary to Inclusivity of Commons</strong></li></ol><p>Traditionally, ownership and control of resources and knowledge have been concentrated in the hands of a few, often leading to exclusivity and restricted access, which can stifle innovation and community development.</p><ul><li>The shift towards the inclusivity of commons advocates for shared access to resources, collaborative management, and open distribution of knowledge. This pattern encourages a community-oriented approach where resources are not owned by a few but stewarded by many, fostering a sense of collective responsibility and mutual benefit.</li><li>Kimberly Wiefling’s promotion of shared resource models exemplifies this transition by encouraging the use of communal assets to benefit the broader community. Similarly, J. Kim Wright’s collaborative legal practices aim to democratize access to justice and legal resources, making them more accessible to all members of society.</li></ul><ol start="5"><li><strong>From Separation of Self and Other to Realization of Interdependence</strong></li></ol><p>A prevalent sense of individualism in many societies emphasizes personal success and independence, often at the expense of communal ties and collective welfare, leading to a fragmented societal structure.</p><ul><li>Recognizing our interdependence involves understanding that individual well-being is intrinsically linked to the well-being of the community and the environment. This pattern fosters a culture of collaboration and mutual support, where collective actions are seen as beneficial to personal and environmental health.</li><li>Ted Rau’s work with sociocracy emphasizes community consent and shared leadership, demonstrating how organizational decisions can benefit from collective wisdom. Shariff Abdullah’s advocacy for interconnected societal transformations further underscores this shift, promoting a unified approach to addressing global challenges.</li></ul><ol start="6"><li><strong>From Limitations of Centralized Structures to Freedom of Distributed Ecosystems</strong>&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Centralized systems concentrate power and decision-making in a limited number of hands, leading to inefficiencies, slower response times, and lower adaptability to local conditions and needs.</p><ul><li>Moving towards distributed ecosystems advocates for decentralizing authority and empowering local nodes within networks, whether these are communities, organizations, or social groups. This approach enhances responsiveness, encourages innovation at multiple levels, and allows for more tailored solutions to local challenges.</li><li>Rick Smyre’s community-based networks, which focus on local autonomy and innovation, exemplify how governance and business models can adapt more dynamically to the community's needs. Ted Rau’s application of sociocracy in organizations decentralizes power, enabling individuals at all levels to contribute to decision-making.</li></ul><ol start="7"><li><strong>From Projection of Career to Dance of Purpose</strong></li></ol><p>Traditional career paths are often linear and defined by external success metrics such as position, salary, and titles. This approach can lead to a disconnect between individual values and daily work, making professional life feel like a series of steps to climb rather than a fulfilling journey.</p><ul><li>The transition to a 'Dance of Purpose' involves redefining work not as a mere career ladder to be climbed but as an expression of personal drives and passions. It emphasizes doing work that not only provides for material needs but also fulfills a sense of purpose and contributes meaningfully to the community.</li><li>Shariff Abdullah transformed from practicing law to focusing on community-oriented missions, embodying a career that aligns with deeper societal values. Kim Wright's shift towards integrative law practices further demonstrates this pattern, where professionals adapt their careers to incorporate healing and holistic approaches that resonate with their personal values.</li></ul><ol start="8"><li><strong>From Static Forecasts of Predictive Models to Fluid Adaptability of Dynamic Realities</strong></li></ol><p>Many traditional planning and forecasting models rely on static assumptions and attempt to predict future events with a high degree of certainty. This often leads to rigid structures that struggle to adapt to new information or unexpected changes, reducing their effectiveness in rapidly changing environments.</p><ul><li>Embracing the fluidity of dynamic realities involves acknowledging the inherent uncertainty of the future and adapting flexibly to emerging trends and information. This approach fosters resilience and allows individuals and organizations to pivot quickly in response to new challenges and opportunities.</li><li>Doug Breitbart’s advocacy for adaptive planning and Rick Smyre’s focus on community-based future preparedness initiatives exemplify this shift. Both highlight the importance of being open to continuous learning and adaptation, rather than adhering strictly to predefined plans.</li></ul><h2 id="a-heartfelt-thank-you">A Heartfelt Thank You</h2><p>To all those who participated in our interviews and to everyone striving to improve our world, we extend our deepest gratitude. Your insights, passion, and dedication are the driving forces behind the heart-driven transformations we are privileged to witness and share through Society 2045. Your efforts inspire hope and action toward a future shaped by authenticity, connection, and profound human essence. Thank you for being the change-makers leading us into a new era.</p><h2 id="next-steps-weaving-a-collective-narrative">Next Steps: Weaving a Collective Narrative</h2><p>Our next step is to weave a story of what could be, as we envision a future where these transformative patterns have significantly altered our society. We acknowledge that such a transformation will take time, many decades, but given the growing number of people actively working to advance these changes in their respective domains, we are hopeful. We hope to see significant progress toward this new societal vision by 2045.</p><p>We invite those interested in participating in this narrative to join us. Your contributions, whether personal stories or visions of the impact your work is making are invaluable. Together, we can create a compelling and inclusive narrative that predicts and inspires the transformative shifts we hope to see in the world.</p><p>Please contact Jose Leal via LinkedIn to participate in this transformative work.</p><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/05/uplifted.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="960" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/uplifted.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/05/uplifted.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/05/uplifted.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">charles blass</span></figcaption></figure><hr><h2 id="some-good-news-about-ai-climate">Some Good News About AI &amp; Climate?</h2><p>by <strong>Gil Friend</strong></p><p>The conversation about “artificial intelligence” (which my wife and muse has long insisted should more accurately be called “simulated intelligence”) is full of apprehension and possibility. A tool more significant than fire. Computers taking over the world. Concerns over trust, hallucination, IP, privacy, recursivity (as AIs inevitably start training on AI output), energy consumption. Oh, and that other kind of power, as new tech giants emerge on the economic landscape…this time not just monetizing our attention but our very words and thoughts.</p><p>Fear and excitement are physiologically identical, we’re told, and we seem to have plenty of both. AIs are coming for your job, we’re told. Or as Scott Galloway puts it, “People who know how to work with AIs are coming for your job.”</p><p>Much of the conversation in the sustainability world has focused on the voracious and rapidly growing energy appetite of current AI technology. (Somehow blind to the __ that the price, performance, and energy footprint of new technologies often changes dramatically as we ride the learning curve and as penetration grows.)</p><p>Peter Leyden, a <a href="https://peterleyden.substack.com/p/the-case-for-techno-optimism-around" rel="noreferrer">confessed techno-optimist</a>, hosted an evening at the San Francisco Ferry Building two weeks ago to explore a different question “Can AI accelerate progress on energy and climate?” What might be possible, in other words, if we turn the unprecedented pattern recognition capabilities of AI, and its ability to iteratively test millions (trillions?) of hypotheses at blinding speed, not only to challenges like medical diagnosis and pharmaceutical innovation but to challenges like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_10">Factor 10</a>—or or Factor 100!—innovation in data center design, electric grid efficiency and stability, transportation system optimization, building design, and more? (Including, ahem, AI energy consumption.)</p><p>The atmosphere was a bit breathless at times, as folks from Google, Microsoft, Stanford, MIT, OtherLab, and a bunch of startups you’ve never heard of laid out their visions and their wares. But it opened a window to a very different sort of exploration than what we’re seeing in the popular press. Some very big things are moving very fast. (Peter hasn’t posted the videos yet; I’ll share them with you <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gfriend">on my LinkedIn</a> once he does.)</p><p>Architect John Picard put the evening to bed:</p><p>“As humans we’re not gonna get it done. We need tools that can see things we can’t see.”</p><p>So, yes, I’ve stepped into the fast-moving river! <em>(To be continued…)</em></p><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-video-card kg-width-regular kg-card-hascaption" data-kg-thumbnail="https://plex.collectivesensecommons.org/content/media/2024/05/pond-reflection-leaves_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

But the limits of client budgets and my availability mean that I can only serve a few people in this direct way. (<a href="mailto:gfriend@natlogic.com?subject=Gil%3A%20I'm%20interested%20in%20exploring%201%3A1%20coaching%20with%20you&amp;body=My%20name%3A%20%0AMy%20email%3A%20%0AMy%20cell%20phone%3A%20%0AMy%20time%20zone%3A%20%0AMy%20current%20primary%20role%3A%20%0AMy%20aspirations%20%2F%20challenges%20%2F%20concerns%3A%20%0AMy%20intentions%20for%20coaching%3A%20%0AMy%20(or%20my%20company's)%20coaching%20budget%3A%20%0A"><strong>If you might be one of them, let’s talk!</strong>)</a> So I’ve been exploring how to share my experience, perspectives, and insights more widely—and less expensively. Which has brought me to this experiment, which I’d like to share with you now.</p><p>For the last six months, Alex Kladitis and I have been hard at work in an AI sandbox, training, testing and refining a generative language model trained on my writing and speaking on “strategic sustainability,” and anonymized conversations with many of my coaching clients.</p><p>Why? To learn by doing, which is often the best way for me to learn. To explore how to make my 50+ years of experience, perspective, and insights on the sustainability/regeneration/business/transformation front lines more widely and richly available. To see whether we can make a useful version of the experience of working with me directly—as an executive coach and strategic advisor—available to more people than I could ever work with one-on-one.</p><p>I’ve learned a ton—both about what this fast-moving technology can—and can’t—do, and, to my surprise, about what and how I do what I do, too.</p><p>There’s plenty more refining to do (and probably always will be) but we’ve decided that it’s time for early release of this AI synthesis/simulation of me. We’re still loading content and refining how it works, but <a href="https://www.delphi.ai/gfriend"><strong>you can take it for a spin here</strong></a>. (And <a href="https://www.delphi.ai/pricing?via=gil">build your own here!</a>)</p><p>I asked it for an explanation of what it is and what it does:</p><p>“What is ‘ontological/ecological/strategic executive coaching?’ How does it differ from other coaching? Why might I want it? How might it help me? “</p><p>Here’s how it responded:</p><p><em>“Ontological/ecological/strategic executive coaching integrates deep understanding of being (ontology), interconnected systems (ecology), and purposeful action (strategy) to enhance leadership effectiveness. Unlike traditional coaching, which often focuses on specific skills or goals, this approach fosters profound shifts in awareness and capability, aligning personal and organizational actions with broader ecological realities and ethical imperatives. You might seek this if you aim to lead with greater clarity, impact, and alignment with global sustainability. It helps by transforming your foundational assumptions and actions, enabling you to navigate complex challenges innovatively and ethically.”</em></p><p>Pretty tight, right?!</p><p><a href="http://www.delphi.ai/gfriend"><strong>So try it out.</strong></a> Work it hard! Use it as your personal coach and advisor—as though you were in an actual conversation with me. Ask “me” anything, 24/7. <strong>My main suggestion <em>to</em> you:</strong> Engage it as a conversation partner, with plenty of back and forth, not as an oracle or one-trick pony. <strong>My only request of you:</strong> Please give me your frank assessment of your experience, and your suggestions for how to improve it.</p><p>Because my intention here isn’t artificial intelligence, nor even simulated intelligence, but something more like <strong><em>“augmented intelligence”</em></strong>—helping us all become smarter and more effective at the work we need to do to meet the challenges we face.</p><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-video-card kg-width-regular kg-card-hascaption" data-kg-thumbnail="https://plex.collectivesensecommons.org/content/media/2024/05/sunset_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

D.<br>Warren paper company upstream from us<br>SDW discharged so much pollution that<br>the river water was brownish-black and a<br>sickly yellow foam floated on its surface<br>It coated anything it touched and was not<br>easily cleaned off when you got home<br>You wouldn't want to eat anything from<br>the Androscoggin in those days and it<br>made me sad to know that in earlier times<br>it was home to an abundance of aquatic<br>life that sustained the Indigenous tribes<br>and the native animals that lived<br>near its banks for countless centuries</p><p>Some days the water smelled so fetid<br>you didn't want to go near the river<br>Other days it wasn't too terrible<br>I was just glad we didn't live upstream</p><p>Brunswick lay on one side of the river<br>Topsham rose up on a hill on the other<br>A bridge downtown handled most traffic<br>Another nearer to me carried freight trains<br>the lower level could accommodate cars<br>but it was in disrepair with a 90° turn at one<br>end and I could hear cars driving over the<br>creaky boards at all hours of the day<br>The car level has since been removed</p><p>A pedestrian bridge also spanned the river<br>That bridge was designed and built by<br>none other than the John A. Roebling Co.<br>The same guy who built the Brooklyn Bridge<br>Everyone calls it: The Swinging Bridge<br>because it swings when the wind blows<br>which is disconcerting for many people<br>I knew people who refused to walk on it<br>My favorite time to use it was in the Spring<br>when winter's thaw would raise the level<br>of the Androscoggin to within inches of<br>the floor of the swinging bridge The winter<br>runoff meant the water was much cleaner<br>It was a rush to stand on that bridge with a<br>raging torrent just inches below your feet</p><p>I was walking that bridge in a thunderstorm<br>when one tower was struck by lightning<br>There was a blinding flash and a huge<br>crashing of thunder all around me<br>Blue-white shards of electricity danced on<br>the supporting cables on either side of me<br>The smell of ozone stung my nostrils<br>Every hair on my body stood on end<br>I seriously thought my life was about to end<br>But the tower had grounded the strike<br>The cables carried a non-lethal discharge<br>I touched no metal on the wooden floor<br>Shaken and stirred I lived to tell the tale</p><p>The banks on the Topsham side of the river<br>are gentler than on the Brunswick side<br>There's a small island just off shore near the<br>bridge we accessed it via a fallen tree and<br>some strategically located boulders being<br>Always careful not to step in the foul water<br>My friends and I used to haunt this island<br>We'd hang out by the water's edge where<br>we'd throw rocks smoke cigarettes and<br>practice being juvenile delinquents<br>(I'm sorry to say we were too good at it)</p><p>One of my friends was a minor dealer<br>He was good for nickel and dime bags<br>My friends would offer me pot but I refused<br>After numerous outings to the island one<br>day they finally convinced me to try it<br>I did and absolutely nothing happened<br>But they kept pressuring me and I kept at it<br>Much to my surprise one day it worked</p><p>I wasn't aware that I was high at first<br>I took a few hits and felt nothing<br>Then I wandered away from the group<br>and suddenly the world seemed to grow<br>both softer and sharper at the same time<br>Light and shadows took on greater depth<br>My breathing slowed as my mind shifted<br>My sense of being in a body expanded<br>My proprioception opened to a larger field<br>Inner and outer space seemed to blend<br>yet simultaneously became more distinct<br>Time felt as fluid as the water flowing by<br>Both sounds and colors were more vibrant<br>All my senses felt sharper and keener</p><p>I looked up at the trees around me<br>(An image I carry to this day)<br>Maine is famous for its tall pine trees<br>I was in a cluster of them and the sun<br>was shining down through their needles<br>It was as if warm fingers caressed my face<br>The sky appeared to be a deeper blue<br>than it had been just a few minutes before</p><p>The sound of the river rushing by washed<br>over me and washed through me<br>The way music does in a concert hall<br>The trees spoke to me of their rootedness<br>The sky offered me its vast spaciousness<br>With closed eyes I could feel with certainty<br>that the rocks under my feet were carrying<br>on a fascinating dialogue with my bones</p><p>All at once I laughed a big loud long laugh<br>A laugh that seemed to come up out<br>of the ground-direct from Gaia Herself<br>It rose up through me exploding into gales<br>of pure mirth as if l'd finally understood the<br>punchline to a rollicking good joke<br>I rejoined my friends who were all quite<br>delighted that I had finally managed to<br>catch a buzz Now do you see why we<br>smoke? I had to admit it was a lovely thing<br>and contrary to the myths I didn't become<br>an addict nor did llose my mind and<br>suddenly turn into a drooling idiot<br>That was my introduction to the magic of<br>plant medicine l've used that medicine in<br>both skillful and irresponsible ways over the<br>last 50+ years and l'm a better person for it</p><p>There've been some incredibly intense<br>periods of daily use and times where I<br>didn't touch it for years on end I've had<br>experiences both mundane and mind-<br>blowing and from speaking with others l've<br>learned that this plant medicine affects<br>people in a wide variety of ways</p><p>I do plant medicine less frequently these <br>days and the delivery vehicle tends to be<br>edibles When I commune with plant<br>medicine I bring an attitude of reverence<br>to it I take time to thank it and ask it for<br>help I treat it as medicine not as an<br>escape (Which it was for many years)</p><p>I find I am nearly always rewarded with<br>an expanded sense of being alive Of<br>wonder and joy and awe at life It fills me<br>with good humor and contentment<br>A sense of harmony unites my body-mind<br>I feel and sense a different way of being<br>a different way of thinking and feeling<br>It helps me get my mind around problems<br>Insights stay with me and inform me<br>long after its effects fade away<br>I get a sense of deepened connection<br>to Gaia to my ancestors and a reminder<br>that my job is to be a good ancestor<br>to those who will walk the Earth after me</p><p>Ken Homer • March 2024</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/05/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="705" height="320" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/05/image.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/05/image.png 705w"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Swinging Bridge in 2020 Pic by </span><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/12357841@N02/50584466043"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Paul VanDerWerf</span></a></figcaption></figure><hr><p>Thank you for reading!
