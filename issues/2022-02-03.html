Thanks for bringing us back to it, Rob! We had a great pop-up call that Sam led to help kick us off on the topic, <a href="https://youtu.be/0yClctxHY9I">2021-01-27 SenseDoing OGM call</a>.</p><h2 id="ogm-money-and-value-conversation">OGM: Money and Value Conversation</h2><p>There has been a really cool conversation about "money" and "value" that started on the OGM mailing list, and then continued during the <a href="https://youtu.be/L_Nx0YcEcow">2021-01-13 "Money" Thursday call</a> that Grace led. We're thinking of creating a Mattermost channel for more ongoing conversations on the topic. Your thoughts?</p><h2 id="ogm-forum-going-read-only-archived">OGM Forum Going Read-Only, Archived</h2><p>RIP <strong>OGM Forum</strong>, we hardly knew ye.</p><p>OGM used a <a href="https://forum.openglobalmind.com/">Discourse forum server</a> for about six months in 2020 and 2021, but for various reasons, conversations ended up moving to other platforms. Having the server active takes a small amount of time and attention from the admin folks, that's starting to seem like wasted effort. Pete will soon decommission the live forum software, and replace it with an archive of the conversations there.</p><h2 id="ogm-jerrys-brain-front-end">OGM: Jerry's Brain Front End</h2><p>Bentley is working with Jerry to create a lightweight, read-only, open-source <strong>Jerry's Brain</strong> front end. It will use Marc-Antoine's and Pete's <strong>MemeBrane</strong> database navigator for TheBrain data as its back end. MemeBrane uses PostgreSQL as its datastore.</p><h2 id="ogm-weaving-the-world-and-the-big-fungus">OGM: Weaving the World (and The Big Fungus)</h2><p>Jerry and Stacey are editing transcripts of four calls intended as the first salvo of the <a href="http://weavingtheworld.org"><strong>Weaving the World</strong></a> podcast. This has also led to many a useful conversation about what “weaving” is, what “the big fungus” is, and how we might do all that together (see SenseDoing above). Expect the first WtW episode to drop Real Soon Now (aka, sometime this month).</p><h2 id="pick-jerry%E2%80%99s-brain-ideation-as-a-service">Pick Jerry’s Brain: Ideation as a Service</h2><p>As part of his evil plan for world domination, Jerry aims to improve his financial stability by offering "Ideation as a Service", with his shingle hung at <a href="https://www.pickjerrysbrain.com/"><strong>PickJerrysBrain.com</strong></a>.

We have been exploring a peer-to-peer (P2P) way to share using <a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a>. Syncthing avoids the complexities of Git and Github, but has only a rudimentary approach to managing versions. Both sharing methods require participants to share a working model of how the systems work, and local "system administration" overhead, at least for now.</p><p>With Page News, pieces (literal pieces and snippets) of code have been written to gather recent changes from Git repositories and the file system. Page News for Syncthing wikis is still in the trial-and-error development phase.</p><p>Both of these efforts have an end goal of simplifying the Massive Wiki onboarding experience for participants.</p><p>For more on these and other Massive Wiki topics, join the <a href="https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/massive-wiki">Massive Wiki chat channel</a>, or join our weekly Zoom call, Wednesdays at Paris, 6:00pm / New York, 12:00pm / Los Angeles, 9:00am Thursday: Sydney, 2:00am.

We all have deep knowledge about who is doing great work on what, but it's barely accessible digitally. NooNet is focused on empowering each of us to contribute our corner of that knowledge to a shared resource / commons in the form of a graph database of great humans, a 'smart swarm'. We can collectively innovate on that, and govern it using the liquid democracy embedded in such networks (see our 2005 LANL - Social Networks for Collective Decision-Making).
