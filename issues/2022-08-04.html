McNeill.</strong> his excerpts from Greg’s prescient 1986 essay are offered for the Plex community:</p><blockquote>My mission is clear. The future of Black culture depends that this generation brings forth a worldly-wise and stoopidfresh intelligentsia of radical bups who can get as ign’ant as James Brown with their Wangs [computers] and stay in the Black. Give me such an army and we’ll be talking total cultural Black rule by the time the ecosystem collapses, SDI bottoms out Fort Knox, the Aryan Brotherhood is officially in the White House, and Wall Street is on the moon.</blockquote><blockquote>Somewhere along the road to probable madness or a meaningful life, I decided that what black culture needs is a popular poststructuralism — accessible writing bent on deconstructing the whole of black culture. Anybody who’s read Harold Cruse’s scathing dissection of black leadership, ‘The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual,’ knows his argument that each generation of black leaders has failed from an inability to conceive black liberation totally and systemically. Meaning they failed to develop agendas that fused protest and reform politics with self-help economics, sophisticated cultural critiques, and a Marxian take on the political economy of capitalism. Twenty years later, the void Cruse railed against remains. If you think I’m going to try to fill it, you got another think coming. I’m bold, but I ain’t that bad. This whatchamajiggy here is about how black aestheticians need to develop a coherent criticism to communicate the complexities of our culture. There’s no periodical on black cultural phenomena equivalent to The Village Voice or Artforum, no publication that provides journalism on black visual art, philosophy, politics, economics, media, literature, linguistics, psychology, sexuality, spirituality, and pop culture. Though there are certainly black editors, journalists, and academics capable of producing such a journal, the disintegration of the black cultural nationalist movement and the braindrain of black intellectuals to white institutions have destroyed the vociferous public dialogue that used to exist between them. Consider this my little shot at opening it up again.</blockquote><p>– Greg Tate, “Cult-Nats Meet Freaky-Deke: Coming Age Of The Post-Nationalist Black Aesthetic,” Village Voice, December 9, 1986</p><p>please also enjoy the program i pulled together the same week he passed, focusing on (among other topics) Greg’s musical outfit of stellar misfits <strong>Burnt Sugar the Arkestra Chamber</strong> (with whom i collaborated). the post also contains a bunch of further resources.</p><p><a href="http://www.lovevolv.org/2021/12/gtbs-gumbo-greg-tate-burnt-sugar.html">GTBS Gumbo: Greg Tate &amp; Burnt Sugar Arkestra 20211209 Sun Radio Celebration [6.75 hours] #thebigplayback</a> (lovevolv.org)</p><p>cb</p><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-video-card kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-video-container"><video src="__GHOST_URL__/content/media/2022/08/2022-08-03-23.22.13.mp4" poster="https://img.spacergif.org/v1/624x832/0a/spacer.png" width="624" height="832" loop autoplay muted playsinline preload="metadata" style="background: transparent url('__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/media-thumbnail-ember416.jpg') 50% 50% / cover no-repeat;" /></video><div class="kg-video-overlay"><button class="kg-video-large-play-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z"/></svg></button></div><div class="kg-video-player-container kg-video-hide"><div class="kg-video-player"><button class="kg-video-play-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z"/></svg></button><button class="kg-video-pause-icon kg-video-hide"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><rect x="3" y="1" width="7" height="22" rx="1.5" ry="1.5"/><rect x="14" y="1" width="7" height="22" rx="1.5" ry="1.5"/></svg></button><span class="kg-video-current-time">0:00</span><div class="kg-video-time">/<span class="kg-video-duration"></span></div><input type="range" class="kg-video-seek-slider" max="100" value="0"><button class="kg-video-playback-rate">1&#215;</button><button class="kg-video-unmute-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M15.189 2.021a9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h1.794a.249.249 0 0 1 .221.133 9.73 9.73 0 0 0 7.924 4.85h.06a1 1 0 0 0 1-1V3.02a1 1 0 0 0-1.06-.998Z"/></svg></button><button class="kg-video-mute-icon kg-video-hide"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M16.177 4.3a.248.248 0 0 0 .073-.176v-1.1a1 1 0 0 0-1.061-1 9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h.114a.251.251 0 0 0 .177-.073ZM23.707 1.706A1 1 0 0 0 22.293.292l-22 22a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.414l.009.009a1 1 0 0 0 1.405-.009l6.63-6.631A.251.251 0 0 1 8.515 17a.245.245 0 0 1 .177.075 10.081 10.081 0 0 0 6.5 2.92 1 1 0 0 0 1.061-1V9.266a.247.247 0 0 1 .073-.176Z"/></svg></button><input type="range" class="kg-video-volume-slider" max="100" value="100"></div></div></div><figcaption>charles blass</figcaption></figure><hr><h2 id="recap-plex-weekly-calendar-office-hours">Recap: Plex Weekly Calendar, Office Hours</h2><p>A quick reminder, the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/calendar/"><strong>Plex Weekly Calendar</strong></a> is a map showing recurring calls and when they fall during the week.

Our civilization has not scaled well to nurture the human species. Lots of us are stressed, or worse, don’t fit in. This is despite the voracious consumption of natural resources, including the human energy.</p><p>I think nature is playing a cosmic joke on us and laughing while we grovel trying to figure out that life is simply wonderful. I don’t personally know how we can get out of the mess, but I want us to crowdsource it together. I want us to play a game which we design and enjoy together.</p><p>In my website, <a href="http://www.game.civilization2.org/">The Civilization 2.0 Game</a>, I tried to think thoroughly through a starting out plan and game design.

There’s no denying that our species is going through a tumultuous phase right now. Most people are aware of the existential threats unfolding all around us. Many of these threats are human-created, and thus my hope is that they can be human-dissolved. The mood of a great number of people is suboptimal for coping with such threats and this mood is fed and amplified to a large degree by both social and broadcast media. To address existential threats, people need access to <strong>moods of wonder, curiosity, ambition, and possibility.</strong></p><p>A few years ago, I was invited to create and teach a course on <em><strong>Coaching Skills for Wellbeing</strong></em> at San Francisco State University. In preparing that course, I realized that I am usually an optimistic person, but that my long-term view of humanity’s prospects is darkened by what I know about the various threats to our biosphere. These threats paint a grim picture of our future, and we don’t yet know how to solve them. My long-term view frequently compromises my ability to stay buoyant in my daily life. I decided to interview some self-identified optimists to see if I could learn from them how to better balance my short-term optimism with my long-term sense of dread. It was a fun and interesting project, and I did indeed gain some significant insights into how to be more balanced. Here’s a summary of my anecdotal findings.</p><p><strong>Who I Spoke With</strong></p><ul><li>Six people</li><li>All over 50</li><li>Three Women and Three Men</li><li>Three People of African Descent</li><li>Three People of European Descent</li></ul><p><strong>Q: When did you realize you were an optimistic person?</strong></p><ul><li>Five out of six said they’ve been optimistic their whole lives.</li><li>One reported she had to learn how to be optimistic.</li><li>Two stated that although they are optimistic people, they struggle with depression and anxiety.</li><li>All spoke of how being optimistic increases their sense of agency, possibility, satisfaction, joy, love, and fulfillment in life.</li></ul><p><strong>Q: How do you maintain an optimistic outlook in the face of daily challenges – big and small?</strong></p><ul><li>Have a sense of The Big Picture – asking: does this really matter in the long run?</li><li>Developing a daily gratitude practice – it is amazing how well this works.</li><li>The Serenity Prayer – accepting what I cannot change, focusing on what I can change.</li><li>Being mindful of what I allow in my life – avoiding negative and toxic conversations, people, news, and environments.</li><li>Seeing events as neutral – it’s not what’s happening, it’s my attitude about what’s occurring that determines if something is good or bad for me.</li><li>Recognizing that I am not my past, it’s how I respond to what happens to me that matters.</li><li>Allowing myself to deeply feel my emotions so they can move through me.</li></ul><p><strong>Q: What specific practices do you turn to when you find yourself tested?</strong></p><p><strong>Top Responses:</strong></p><ul><li>Exercise – I get moving and get my heart rate up.</li><li>Diet – I make sure I am avoiding junk foods and eating health supportive foods instead.</li><li>Time in nature – being outdoors opens up different perspectives.</li><li>Calling friends and family who will lift me up.</li><li>Meditation – sitting or moving: accessing a calmer, quieter space within.</li><li>Self-compassion – I am one person, not everything is up to me.</li><li>Accepting and reframing – asking, how can I turn this to my advantage?</li><li>Be able to vent – have people you can vent to who will listen and say: OK, now what?</li><li>Steering by rear view mirror* – remembering challenges my ancestors overcame.</li><li>Prayer – faith in God, Nature, a Higher Power, or a Benevolent Presence.</li><li>Blending with – the practice of stepping into and moving with the resistance.</li><li>Zooming out – expanding the timeframe to 10,000 years.</li><li>Practice dwelling in not knowing, giving space to complex and confounding things.</li><li>Envisioning the world if all the terrible things I think of don’t actually come to pass.</li><li>Paying attention to my body and my thought loops.</li><li>Knowing that everything changes in its own time, accepting that I can’t push the river.</li></ul><p><strong>Q: When have you been hard pressed to stay optimistic?</strong></p><p><strong>Dealing with:</strong></p><ul><li>Major health crisis.</li><li>Loss of loved one.</li><li>Difficult family matter/member.</li><li>Coming to grips with own mortality.</li><li>Coping with depression.</li></ul><p><strong>Q: How do you use optimism when dealing with transitions?</strong></p><ul><li>Seeing challenge as opportunity for growth.</li><li>Recalling lessons I’ve learned when I’ve gone through other rough patches.</li><li>Keeping my sense of humor – life is too tragic to take seriously.</li><li>Talking out my feelings with trusted friends or family members.</li><li>Telling the truth about what is happening – don’t sugarcoat or succumb to denial.</li><li>Fully feeling any difficult emotions while knowing that they will pass, and that I will grow from the experience.</li><li>Focusing on what is possible and what I can do now with what I have, where I am.</li><li>Reaching out and asking for help.</li></ul><p><strong>Q: How do you use optimism when dealing with transitions?</strong></p><ul><li>Building momentum from small things.</li><li>Acknowledging fear and listening to love.</li><li>Being insatiably curious!</li><li>Staying in touch with childlike wonder.</li><li>Focusing on what I can do and letting the rest take care of itself.</li><li>Never give up!

They were thrown into a world where they had no legal rights as human beings (see SCOTUS’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott">Dred Scott </a>decision). They did not give up hope but persevered and so when she is feeling overwhelmed, she draws on their strength and fortitude because, as she put it: “if they didn’t give up despite being virtually powerless in the face of horrible repression, I can’t let them down by succumbing to my despair when I have so much more agency than they did.”</p><p><em>* “Steering through the rearview mirror” came from a person of African descent.</em></p><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-video-card kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-video-container"><video src="__GHOST_URL__/content/media/2022/08/PXL_20220720_035132321-ANIMATION.mp4" poster="https://img.spacergif.org/v1/360x640/0a/spacer.png" width="360" height="640" loop autoplay muted playsinline preload="metadata" style="background: transparent url('__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/media-thumbnail-ember399.jpg') 50% 50% / cover no-repeat;" /></video><div class="kg-video-overlay"><button class="kg-video-large-play-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z"/></svg></button></div><div class="kg-video-player-container kg-video-hide"><div class="kg-video-player"><button class="kg-video-play-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z"/></svg></button><button class="kg-video-pause-icon kg-video-hide"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><rect x="3" y="1" width="7" height="22" rx="1.5" ry="1.5"/><rect x="14" y="1" width="7" height="22" rx="1.5" ry="1.5"/></svg></button><span class="kg-video-current-time">0:00</span><div class="kg-video-time">/<span class="kg-video-duration"></span></div><input type="range" class="kg-video-seek-slider" max="100" value="0"><button class="kg-video-playback-rate">1&#215;</button><button class="kg-video-unmute-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M15.189 2.021a9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h1.794a.249.249 0 0 1 .221.133 9.73 9.73 0 0 0 7.924 4.85h.06a1 1 0 0 0 1-1V3.02a1 1 0 0 0-1.06-.998Z"/></svg></button><button class="kg-video-mute-icon kg-video-hide"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M16.177 4.3a.248.248 0 0 0 .073-.176v-1.1a1 1 0 0 0-1.061-1 9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h.114a.251.251 0 0 0 .177-.073ZM23.707 1.706A1 1 0 0 0 22.293.292l-22 22a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.414l.009.009a1 1 0 0 0 1.405-.009l6.63-6.631A.251.251 0 0 1 8.515 17a.245.245 0 0 1 .177.075 10.081 10.081 0 0 0 6.5 2.92 1 1 0 0 0 1.061-1V9.266a.247.247 0 0 1 .073-.176Z"/></svg></button><input type="range" class="kg-video-volume-slider" max="100" value="100"></div></div></div><figcaption>Peter Kaminski</figcaption></figure><hr><h2 id="%E2%80%9Ctools-for-thinking%E2%80%9D-events">“Tools for Thinking” Events</h2><p>by <strong>Jerry Michalski</strong></p><p>I am helping <a href="http://betaworks.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">betaworks</a>, a venture capital firm and accelerator based in New York City, produce a series of very OGMy events focused on <strong>Tools for Thinking.</strong> The first event is a hybrid, all-afternoon session on August 16, <a href="https://www.betaworks.com/event/render-tools-for-thinking"><strong>RENDER: Tools For Thinking</strong></a>.

A government held captive by special interests will suppress information traveling up because it interferes with the narrative that drives self-serving decisions, creating a vicious cycle of inefficiencies.</p><p>To force non-violent change into the system requires intervention at paradigm level, which must then be reinforced along the stages of implementation. Systems adaptation requires uniform information along the entire chain, customized to the context of each part of the system that may be uniquely impacted. </p><h3 id="places-to-intervene-in-a-system">Places to Intervene in a System</h3><p>(in increasing order of effectiveness)</p><p>9. Constants, parameters, numbers (subsidies, taxes, standards).<br>8. Regulating negative feedback loops.<br>7. Driving positive feedback loops.<br>6. Material flows and nodes of material intersection.<br>5. Information flows.<br>4. The rules of the system (incentives, punishments, constraints).<br>3. The distribution of power over the rules of the system.<br>2. The goals of the system.<br>1. The mindset or paradigm out of which the system — its goals, power structure, rules, its culture — arises.</p><p>Changing our relationship with food is a profound undertaking, no matter what the reason. Understanding that the way we grow and raise food is polluting and damaging the entire ecosystem, the oceans, watersheds, soil, air, our health, and then processing that in a personal context-specific way to adapt and change behavioral patterns.</p><p>Thinking about how different segments of the population experience food in unique, emotional ways, interpret the implications, isolating what exactly would encourage change in specific population segments.</p><p>Climate change for some, watershed pollution for others, chemicals in the food supply, biodiversity, pollinator habitats, animal cruelty, cancers, diabetes, obesity, heart disease ........ unique stories focused on segment specific resonance. <br>While the regenerative movement has made great progress to explain the pathologies of the industrial food system, and to offer real alternatives to regenerate soil and water, it has not been able to translate the implications of what that means to the general public. As the corporate driven legislative process solidifies its opposition, a well-informed and engaged public must provide the pull and demand change.</p><p>Back to target group marketing, developing communications strategies that can flow around, under, over the existing paradigms.
