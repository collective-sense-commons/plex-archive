<p><em>The Biweekly Plex Dispatch is an inter-community newspaper published by&nbsp;</em><a href="https://collectivesensecommons.org/?ref=plex.collectivesensecommons.org"><em>Collective Sense Commons</em></a><em>&nbsp;on first and third Wednesdays of each month.

I’m planning to wrap up and publish the final issue of Plex on <strong>September 17th, 2025.</strong></p><p>My plan with CSC Mattermost is to start to notify folks, export channel data, and to shut it down by <strong>early October 2025.</strong></p><p>Both services have had a good run. They’ve helped connect people, form groups, and provide community scaffolding. Thank you so much for being part of them!<br><br>But neither service has developed the kind of larger-scale inter-community engagement I was hoping for. Neither service is <em>too</em> much of a bother, but getting the newsletter together twice a month or for Mattermost, keeping the server running, making sure the software and the OS are up-to-date, and stepping in once in a while to solve problems, it’s not zero, either. It’s feeling like time to put these loads down and to pick up others.<br><br>Also, for chat, the landscape has changed. In the intervening years since 2020, along with the OGM mailing list that existed then and now, I feel like some additional alternatives have gotten real: Signal, Discord, Mastodon, Bluesky, Matrix. It’s not like folks don’t have places that fit their needs, probably better than CSC Mattermost.<br><br>You know the saying, “Better to light a candle than to curse the darkness?” I’m glad I lit these candles, and they have been beacons in some amount of darkness. But these candles are not in the spot to help the most people any more. These days, I need to find better ways to help.</p><p>The fact that it stings a little to think about shutting them down tells me they mattered. Maybe that’s how you know when something was worth trying.<br><br>For CSC Mattermost, I can imagine an option for a group of community stewards to rally and help me keep the lights on. But I’m not holding my breath on that, and I’m genuinely at peace with wrapping it up. I’m also pretty sure any effort to reinvigorate CSC Mattermost would be better spent adopting community on Signal, Discord, or Matrix. Let me know if you’d like to talk more about that.<br><br>Dear Plex readers and CSC Mattermost members: Thank you SO much for your readership and support along the way. It’s meant a lot to me, and I truly appreciate it.<br><br>Yours in community,</p><p>Pete</p><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-video-card kg-width-regular kg-card-hascaption" data-kg-thumbnail="https://plex.collectivesensecommons.org/content/media/2025/09/capitalism-night_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

        </figure><hr><h2 id="bits-and-piecessnapstack">Bits and Pieces - SnapStack</h2><p>by <strong>Peter Kaminski</strong></p><p>Hey, I’m excited to tell you about a new project I’m working on, <strong>SnapStack.</strong> In the Massive Wiki - MarkPub universe, it will provide an alternative to Git for <strong>sharing</strong> and <strong>versioning</strong> files. If it sounds interesting and you want to follow along, send me an email: <a href="mailto:kaminski@istori.com">kaminski@istori.com</a>.</p><p>(In “Massive Wiki”, the word “Massive” is inspired by an acronym, “MaSVF”. The word “Wiki” represents naming and easy linking between pages, as well as the “wiki culture” of collaborative writing. MaSVF stands for&nbsp;<strong>Ma </strong>rkdown, <strong>S</strong>&nbsp;hared, <strong>V</strong>&nbsp;ersioned, <strong>F</strong>&nbsp;iles.)</p><p>SnapStack will be a light collection of workflows and collaborative agreements for a small, cohesive team, say 3-10 people, to use. It will use IPFS as a decentralized, immutable storage commons, IPNS for a canonical pointer to the most recent version of the wiki / vault / repository being worked on, and some lightweight versioning, in a version chain. The workflows are straightforward enough that you could just use a checklist to run through them as you pull and push new versions, but I expect we’ll build some lightweight software to automate the workflows.</p><p>A mostly non-technical explanation of IPFS: It’s like there’s a magical interplanetary disk drive, and you can use any of various gateways to access it. You give your local gateway a “content ID” (a CID), and it magically retrieves and gives you the corresponding file.</p><p>Underneath, it’s decentralized / distributed. Your local gateway node connects to a variety of other nodes around the solar system, and they all exchange a distributed hash table of who’s got which file. When you request a file that your local node doesn’t have, it asks around if anyone else has seen that file (by ID), until someone says, sure, here you go. Then you get the file. Kinda like interlibrary loan, but with many more books.</p><p>(Small tweak, the files are actually handled in chunks, usually around 256KB, and your gateway might get chunks of the file from different servers.)</p><p>Content-addressed storage is key. Files are identified by cryptographic hashes of their content rather than location-based addresses. This ensures content integrity and enables the decentralized model.</p><p>A “cryptographic hash” is another magical thing. It’s a bit of math that any computer can run when it looks at a file, which produces a unique ID from the contents of the file. So there’s a perfect 1:1 correspondence between the ID and the file or any exact copy of the file. But if the file changes even one little bit, the math generates a different ID!</p><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-video-card kg-width-regular kg-card-hascaption" data-kg-thumbnail="https://plex.collectivesensecommons.org/content/media/2025/09/calculator_papers_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

I think this woman needs CPR!<br>She gestured and I saw a woman<br>laying in the middle of the street</p><p>I turned off my engine ran to her side<br>I took her pulse and a line I had heard<br>so often on TV medical shows ran<br>through my mind: Pulse rapid and thready<br>I never knew what that meant until<br>my fingers transmitted the message to me</p><p>I looked more carefully at her<br>She was maybe mid-60s slightly<br>overweight with a boxy plain face<br>Her skin was pale and waxy<br>Her eyes were open but blank and<br>unseeing Her pupils hugely dilated<br>I didn’t need a medical degree<br>to know she was in bad shape</p><p>I asked the woman who flagged me over<br>What’s your name? Kathy, was her reply<br>Please call 911 and give them our location<br>I took the prone woman’s hand and I tried<br>to speak with as much reassurance and<br>confidence as I could muster: Stay with us<br>We’re going to see through this–hang on<br>Just then she stopped breathing</p><p>Kathy we’re going to have to perform CPR<br>I’ll do the breaths and you do the<br>compressions–can you do that?<br>She looked panicked–I don’t know how<br>Don’t worry I’ll show you–it’s simple<br>Kneel beside her–you will need to use<br>your body weight not your arms or you<br>will quickly become exhausted<br>She got into position–Good now put<br>your left hand right here where her ribs<br>meet her sternum then place your right<br>hand on top of your left and interlace<br>your fingers like this–I demonstrated<br>Now bending forward from your waist<br>with your arms straight press down 2 inches<br>to push air out of her lungs then release<br>You need to count each compression<br>When you get to 15, l’ll give her<br>three breaths while you rest—is that clear?<br>Kathy looked stricken but nodded<br>It’ll be okay Kathy, we’ll do this together!</p><p>Ready? Begin! Kathy counted to fifteen<br>I opened the unconscious woman's mouth<br>placed my mouth over hers and exhaled<br>Immediately I felt my breath flow not into<br>Her lungs but into my right ear–Damnit!<br>I had totally forgotten to check her mouth<br>For obstacles and to pinch her nose shut<br>I did those two things and tried again</p><p>Her chest rose–I gave her another breath<br>Okay Kathy, start the compressions again<br>There was a cracking noise–Kathy froze<br>It's okay you cracked a rib just keep going<br>She did 15 more and I did the breaths</p><p>About ten minutes into the process, I had<br>the distinct feeling that we were working<br>on a woman who was not going to live<br>I noticed that she had voided her bladder<br>I had the strangest feeling that she had left<br>her body and was watching us work<br>Some part of me could feel her nearby</p><p>Just then a car horn blared at us<br>looked up to see a man in a brand new<br>Mercedes Benz motioning for us to clear<br>the road so that he could drive by us<br>lignored him but he kept honking Then<br>he yelled at us: You're blocking the road!<br>I wanted to yell back that he was a<br>complete asshat but instead I shouted that<br>We’re trying to save a woman’s life<br>He turned sped off in the other direction<br>Laying rubber to express his displeasure<br>My judgments about people accustomed<br>to privilege (it’s an epidemic in Mill Valley)<br>nearly got the better of me but I returned<br>my focus to trying to save this woman</p><p>I checked the time it had been nearly<br>twenty minutes since Kathy called 911<br>Where the hell are the paramedics?<br>We didn’t have to wait much longer<br>I could hear the sirens approaching</p><p>When they arrived, they looked over at us<br>Then they took their time getting prepared<br>I suspect that they could see it was<br>a hopeless case and felt no urgency<br>One of them was smoking a cigarette<br>he took a final drag and approached</p><p>Okay we’re here–you can go now<br>Kathy and I stood down we were both<br>agitated by the adrenaline flooding us<br>I still had the feeling that the woman<br>had left her body but was hovering nearby<br>I looked up and whispered to her:<br>Go towards the light that’s where you’ll<br>find healing and your next adventure!</p><p>We watched them put the ambu bag<br>over her mouth and start the compressions<br>The cigarette smoker turned to us once<br>more: You can go now we’ve got it</p><p>I asked Kathy if she wanted to go<br>Her eyes said no as she shook her head<br>We had both devoted considerable<br>effort to saving this woman and<br>neither of us was ready to simply<br>walk away just because the paramedics<br>had taken over for us and told us to go</p><p>We told him that we wanted to stay<br>Suit yourself—he shrugged turned away<br>They worked on her for a few more<br>minutes before loading her into the<br>Ambulance and driving off with no sirens</p><p>Kathy hugged and thanked me<br>We said goodbye to each other<br>Two strangers who would never see each<br>other again united by a moment of crisis<br>determined to do all we could to help</p><p>I returned to work and was immediately<br>assailed by my boss with several demands<br>She was leaving the next day and there<br>was still a lot to do to get ready<br>There was no time for me to process what<br>I had just experienced, nor could I tell her<br>I got to work but was in an altered state<br>I have no idea what I did in the remaining<br>hours before heading home that night</p><p>My wife took one look at my face when I<br>got home and asked me what happened<br>I told her of the afternoon’s events<br>We both sat in a kind of stunned silence<br>Then she suggested that I call the hospital</p><p>I did call them and was told that policy<br>dictated that they couldn’t tell me<br>anything as it would violate confidentiality<br>I played on her sympathies–explained<br>I had spent 20 minutes doing CPR and just<br>wanted to know the result of my efforts<br>I wasn’t after any names or details<br>only if the woman who was admitted lived<br>I’m not supposed to say, she told me<br>But if it were me I’d want to know too<br>I’m sorry to tell you that she didn’t make it</p><p>Days later an obit appeared in the paper<br>she was Carolyn King—a retired teacher<br>She’d been diagnosed as bipolar and was<br>living in a group home near where Kathy<br>found her–somehow Carolyn had<br>managed to pull two people to her side<br>so that she didn’t die alone or uncared for<br>We were there–we witnessed her parting<br>We wished her well–RIP Carolyn King</p><p>Ken Homer • March 2024</p><p><em>Note: CPR has been revised to compressions only</em></p><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-video-card kg-width-regular kg-card-hascaption" data-kg-thumbnail="https://plex.collectivesensecommons.org/content/media/2025/09/ferris_wheel_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">
