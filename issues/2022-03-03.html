<p><em>The Biweekly Plex Dispatch is an inter-community newspaper published by <a href="https://collectivesensecommons.org/">Collective Sense Commons</a> on first and third Wednesdays of each month. Price per issue: <a href="https://biweekly-plex-dispatch.ghost.io/remittance">1 USD, or your choice of amount</a> (even zero).</em></p><h2 id="upgrading-csc-agora-on-mattermost">Upgrading CSC Agora on Mattermost</h2><p>The instance of Mattermost where <strong><a href="https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/">CSC Agora</a></strong> lives has needed an upgrade for a while, and <strong>Peter Kaminski</strong> has finally gotten the stars to align to make it happen soon, perhaps even this weekend, 5-6 March.</p><p>We will be upgrading from an older 5.29.0 version to the newest 6.4 version, which among other things, should fix the annoying “Server upgrade required” popup on mobile devices. A new deployment method should also make future upgrades much easier and more frequent, with less disruption.</p><p>Due to database changes between version 5.x to version 6.x,  a few things will happen:</p><ul><li>Everybody will need a password reset. There will be a one-time requirement to use the “I forgot my password” link to reset your password to sign into the new version. It’s okay to use the same password as the previous version if desired.</li><li>All your channels and DMs will be marked unread; just select a channel to mark it read again.</li><li>Previously-posted messages with attachments will lose the attachments. Email <a href="mailto:kaminski@istori.com">Pete</a> to access any critical attachments from the archive after the upgrade.</li></ul><p>Stay tuned to “Town Square” for more information as it becomes available. You’ll also receive an email with information before the upgrade. Join the <a href="https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/meta-csc">[csc] Meta</a> channel for discussion about the upgrade.</p><h2 id="upcoming-plex-events-from-trove">Upcoming Plex Events from Trove</h2><p><strong>Vincent Arena</strong> did a neat thing with <a href="https://www.catalist.network/"><strong>Trove</strong></a>, and developed a way to export a list of <strong>events that Trove knows about</strong>.

We call it “Sensemaking Emergent Events” (SEE).</p><p>We’ve started an CSC Agora (Mattermost) channel to collect information about the Ukraine crisis: <a href="https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/see-ukraine">[see] Ukraine</a>.

Tibet says, “If you are going to be there in Austin come to the panel and let’s connect! We also may organize a small gathering of folks.”</p><blockquote>The early decades of the 21st century are characterised by global social, economic, and ecological crises. Yet the recent proliferation of tech-for-good initiatives often exacerbate the challenges they seek to address, with business models frequently relying upon locking data in proprietary silos, and robbing participants of their privacy and agency as a result. So how do we design the platforms of the future without replicating the pitfalls of the past?<br><br>Join this critical conversation with leaders co-creating the next generation of global digital infrastructure as we address key design considerations including interoperability, data sovereignty, and decentralisation, and opportunities for collaboration, cooperation, and coordination across a growing ecosystem of aligned organisations.</blockquote><h2 id="living-between-worlds">Living Between Worlds</h2><p><em>New worlds don</em>’<em>t just happen.

One of my mottos is “People grow in the direction of the questions they ask.” Recently, I was part of a facilitation team delivering a program called Leading Through Influence, to the senior leadership of a $15 billion company. We had cohorts attending from New York, Paris, Milan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Seoul, and Tokyo.</p><p>One section contained a series of questions for building stakeholder alliances, however, the questions were deficit-based with no focus on strengths. I proposed an appreciative alternative which the author of the program graciously and enthusiastically embraced. Below are my questions:</p><h3 id="questions-for-building-stakeholder-alliances">Questions for Building Stakeholder Alliances</h3><ul><li>What is this person’s (formal and informal) relationship to me?</li><li>What’s the best way for us to establish a solid partnership?</li><li>What strengths can we build on?</li><li>How can I enlist them as an ally for my business project?</li><li>What might I be doing that’s working against our partnership?</li><li>What obstacles need overcoming and what’s my strategy for that?</li><li>What agreements do we have in place to handle conflict when it arises?</li><li>What did we explicitly agree to and set forth as clear goals and expectations?</li><li>What practices have we agreed to in order to bring out the best in each other?</li><li>How is our communication? Do we regularly review and assess what we’re learning?</li><li>If I am experiencing resistance, where is it coming from and how can I best address it?</li><li>What else can be done to strengthen our partnership?</li></ul><p>It may require considerable time to answer these in depth, but doing so greatly improves the likelihood of success for all concerned.</p><h2 id="embracing">Embracing</h2><p>by <strong>Stewart Levine</strong>, reproduced here with kind permission</p><p>Warm syrup flows within<br>Quiet mind no chattering chagrin<br>Silence black empty space<br>No concern running this race</p><p>Serene presence calming pure<br>Heart body mind aligned to ensure<br>Essence embraces those you hold<br>Daily giving never old</p><p>Uncover what’s inside<br>Navigate your personal tide<br>Thoughtful sharing never whim<br>Treasured wisdom from within</p><p>Make sure family has peaceful sleep<br>Drying teardrops before they weep<br>Longing only to give take care<br>Helping others get to where</p><p>Peace from knowing who you are<br>Where you fit how you star<br>Integrity to the bone<br>In a crowd silence of alone</p><p>Perch you alight quiet perspective<br>Not from any outer directive<br>Sourcing wisdom from your soul<br>Agenda sometimes takes a toll</p><h2 id="about-the-%E2%80%9C182-calls%E2%80%9D-header-image">About the “182 Calls” Header Image</h2><p>by Peter Kaminski for BPD</p><p>You can download a larger 4760 × 2496 image without the “Biweekly Plex Dispatch” wording here:</p>

        <p>I wanted to have some image of “The Plex” for the BPD header image this week, and decided to create a composite of many Zoom call recording thumbnails. I like the finished image – it makes me happy to look at all the very familiar and less familiar faces from all our calls.</p><p>Jerry Michalski has done a great job of posting recordings of Zoom calls for OGM (and related communities such as IJB and REX), so I went to his channel to gather thumbnails.</p><p>My work process:</p><ul><li>Look around for an app or website to make collage / montage / contact sheet images.</li><li>Settle on <strong><a href="https://patdavid.net/2013/04/using-imagemagick-to-create-contact/">montage</a></strong>, one of the tools in the ImageMagick suite.</li><li>Install ImageMagick on my Mac using Homebrew.</li><li>Navigate to and scroll down Jerry’s channel page to preload lots of thumbnails into the browser page.</li><li>Save the page to my computer.</li><li>Sort through the thumbnail JPEGs in the saved directory, pick out those with three people or more; discard the rest.</li><li>Fiddle with <strong>montage</strong>, and hit on 182 (14 x 13) as a good number of thumbnails, so there aren’t any blank spots in the composite. This required discarding nine thumbnails; I chose them at random.</li><li>Use Photoshop to add the BPD text.</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Thanks for reading! </strong>Next edition will be published on 16 March 2022.
