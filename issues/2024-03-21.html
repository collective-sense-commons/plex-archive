On March 25, 1995, Ward Cunningham launched the Portland Pattern Repository, which is still available today at&nbsp;<a href="http://wiki.c2.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://wiki.c2.com/</a><br><br>Since then, countless other wikis have been born exploring everything from patterns &amp; pattern languages to organizations, to fandoms, to journalistic efforts, to individual projects, to entire movements, and beyond, including of course many of the world's largest encyclopedias. Countless people use wikis every day, because wikis have become a key part of how humans tell – and edit – our stories.<br><br>A few dozen people were on a 25th anniversary WikiBirthday call a few years ago, which provoked much joy. In the hopes of having a similarly wonderful time together this year, some of us have organized a couple of video calls to meet with other wiki aficionados. Ward Cunningham will be with us on both of these calls, and we hope you can join us as well!<br><br>This invite is also going out to other community-minded technologists, unconference and Open Space organizers, artists, Wikipedians, and many others. It's a chance to share what you are up to with wiki lately, and any new (&amp; old) wiki tools you find useful or promising. We can also highlight past wiki successes, mourn those no longer with us and wiki efforts which didn't work out, reflect on lessons learned, etc.<br><br>First call:<br>10am US Pacific time, 1pm US East, 5pm UK, 6pm Berlin, 10:30pm Mumbai, 4am Sydney<br><a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/j/81142486161" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://us02web.zoom.us/j/81142486161</a><br><br>Second call:<br>6pm Pacific, 9pm East, 1am UK, 2am Berlin, 6:30am Mumbai, noon Sydney<br><a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/j/82738497575" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://us02web.zoom.us/j/82738497575</a><br><br>And finally, we can imagine together what we might do for the bigger, 30th anniversary next year.<br><br>Please do pass this invitation, or craft one of your own, on to whomever would help us have a wiki time!<br><br>— Slow (John Abbe), Mark Dilley, and Ethan McCutchen</p><hr><h2 id="tom-atlees-co-intelligence-book">Tom Atlee's Co-Intelligence Book</h2><h3 id="book-launch-on-wednesday-march-27-on-zoom">Book launch on Wednesday, March 27 on Zoom</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/c5cd790b-41cb-46ae-a0bd-e28e590e5fef.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1190" height="1683" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/c5cd790b-41cb-46ae-a0bd-e28e590e5fef.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/c5cd790b-41cb-46ae-a0bd-e28e590e5fef.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/c5cd790b-41cb-46ae-a0bd-e28e590e5fef.jpg 1190w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><strong>You are invited</strong>&nbsp;to join the Co-Intelligence Institute for a very special occasion: the online book launch event for Tom Atlee’s new book, <em>Co-Intelligence - The Applied Wisdom of Wholeness, Interconnectedness, and Co-Creativity.</em><br><br>We’re so pleased to let you know Tom's book on Co-Intelligence has just been released and is already receiving a lot of positive feedback.

Better for the people in their network who would have given to a GoFundMe.</p><p>So the innovation is targeted at people without the economic power of much money. The justice-focused nonprofits in the orbit of the host for our Act Local School class I am starting with my daughter B.J. Harden Jones this week seem to be eager for it and plan to attend our class on the Give2Invest Tool on March 20. You can zoom in, but it’s in person at our hosts, the Asheville Poverty Initiative.</p><p>She is like my handler, she says. She reminds me to listen and makes it interactive instead of me sort of pushing my vision all the time and sometimes getting frustrated when it takes people longer to get it than I like. She explains and facilitates people getting on board.</p><p>This is a family business and she’s good at guiding conversations toward goals and that’s a lot of how the market around Neighborhood Economics is growing; through helping people set up complex partnerships that are modular and easily adaptable; low friction coordination when needed is the goal. Or sometimes we just bring the innovation into the room and let people jump in to be engaged on their own; you provide time and space for that.</p><p>We see the Give2Invest tool as an important means to create what we really want; community engagement around economic principles that create healthy interdependence in a community across race, class, and zip code. We want these new tools we showcase to help local people, new alliances, focus on repairing some of the structural and systemic damage done, like subverting redlining following Joe Minicozi’s plan at Urban3.</p><p>We want to see G2I spread through uncoordinated innovation, propagated like dandelions, creating small, smart giving circles focused on a cause that matters. And then those circles overlap and build new emergent layers. That’s the plan.</p><p>Hired a couple of people. One to focus on biomedicinals in our bioregion using the Give2Invest tool. We have a propagation method of biomedicinals safely from seed or rhizome as opposed to the wild harvest that ravages the countryside as they hunt for ginseng and also damage the land where golden seal and black cohosh grow. A college here, Warren Wilson, can propagate them in their 3,000 sf forestry nursery and understory production acres. We are increasingly deep partners with the college, which is directly across the river from our farm, like 30 yards away.</p><p>We can transform the biomedicinals industry into something healthier, and we can create a niche in the market for that standard that increases demand so that the producers, just inching by, can thrive on increased demand. We use that to get access to Gaia, the big dog company that buys from us, with that standard added to their product line.</p><p>We use that further leverage, once we get there, to do more of our plan to make the smallholders, the healers who are also gig workers, more economically resilient. We need to raise money for that standard; Guaranteed from Seed, to be seen as an important, incremental but timely step above the rest of the market that it is. </p><p>We use that small window of brand premium as a lever to transform the market into something that works better for small producers in our bioregion. We sell to tourists who see the value of it, which grows the demand that gets Gaia on board.</p><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-video-card kg-width-regular kg-card-hascaption" data-kg-thumbnail="https://plex.collectivesensecommons.org/content/media/2024/03/birds-1_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

        </figure><hr><h2 id="on-collective-cyborg">On Collective Cyborg</h2><p>by <strong>George Pór</strong></p><p>I’ve just listened to&nbsp; an inspiring podcast of Ross Dawson, <a href="https://amplifyingcognition.com/potential-humans-plus-ai-ac-ep28/">The potential of Humans plus AI</a>. His guests included one of my fave technosophers, Jerry Michalski. In a <a href="https://community.humansplus.ai/c/what-s-new-in-ai/humans-ai-highlights-podcast">forum</a> hosted by Ross, I wrote what follows.</p><p>That was a great podcast! I loved the questions that you asked. Besides the quality of the guests’ thinking, what tells an amazing podcast apart from a mediocre one is the space from which the questions come. (After sitting through some podcasts where i was submitted to clueless hosts, I became more selective about which invitation to accept.)<br><br>I particularly resonated with Jerry Michalski’s take on your cyborg question. He said,<br><br>“<strong>the other piece of being a better cyborg is not about being a lonely cyborg. But what does it mean to be in a collective of cyborgs?</strong> What does it mean to be in a cyborg space? What does it mean to co-inhabit cyborg intelligence with other people and other intelligences that are just going to get faster and better at this thing?”<br><br>I guess the “collective cyborg” is what I <a href="https://community.humansplus.ai/c/future-of-ai-bcf164/the-case-for-cyborgs#comment_wrapper_32663016">referred</a> to as “superorganism.” There are more and more future-responsive techno-philosophers who are interpreting current trends along those lines.<br><br>But is that enough? What if we transposed Marx’s famous quote, “<strong>Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it,</strong>” to our present-day context?<br><br>Extrapolating our interpretation of the current “human x AI” trend to the collective level, isn’t the point to devise ways to test the <a href="https://community.humansplus.ai/c/future-of-ai-bcf164/the-case-for-cyborgs#comment_wrapper_32663016">“superorganism” hypothesis</a> with some kind of action-oriented research? I believe it is and I welcome Expressions of Interest from those colleagues who want to help in carry it forward.</p><p>P.S. Collective sense makers, who are also “big picture” thinkers and action-oriented visionaries, do need to apply.&nbsp; Extra good points for having AI savvy and metamodern sensibility. Address it to <a href="mailto:george.por@gmail.com">george.por@gmail.com</a> and include [EoS] with your name on the subject line.</p><hr><h2 id="evolving-strategy-lifeboat-labs">Evolving Strategy: Lifeboat Labs</h2><p>by <strong>Douglass Carmichael</strong></p><p>You must watch and cogitate about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2F8yisiS6E">NVIDIA keynote</a>.</p><p>This is clever and fun, even shocking for scale, but my sense is that it is boring and strips our movements in the world of proximity to real people. I want the hint of real people in my interactions. AI removes that, giving us fake proxies. The proxies with NVIDIA extend to the whole world.</p><p>I am trying to develop the next level strategy ahead of and after initiating Gardenworlds.</p><p>A few years ago, I proposed the idea of Gardenworld and its politics [1] as a way into a viable approach to the climate-induced collapse that we were likely to experience. But then, as the reality of collapse became clear, I added the idea of lifeboats, and that successful lifeboats would become garden worlds and Gardenworlds could become centers of arts and conversation and hence elements of nascent civilizations, with access to the deep past of humanity which would be preserved in many places and forms and hence allowing rapid production at higher levels in arts, governance, and science.</p><p>I now want to call the Lifeboats <strong>lifeboat labs</strong> as places for, amongst life-sustaining necessities, places to experiment with new forms of human society, leaving behind war, capitalism, and much of the rest.</p><p>The strategy of first Lifeboats has a major advantage over Gardenworld because it is about preparation without dismantling current life patterns, and hopefully more attractive. The switch from current agriculture, often industrial, to Gardenworld, is too threatening and still considered unnecessary by most people. We need a stepping stone in between doing nothing and deep action.</p><p>You know how it goes, <em>n</em> people and <em>n</em> chairs and music. When the music stops the gods remove one chair and the <em>n</em> people struggle to fill the <em>n minus 1</em> chairs. A moment of rushed chaos and then quiet as the chairs are filled and it is clear who lost out, and the music starts again. (I remember this from grade school in NYC.)</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/f6d1ace7-d3b5-405a-8529-2481e4c99ecf_600x400.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Palm trees, with golden sunlight behind them and swampy water in the foreground." loading="lazy" width="600" height="400" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/f6d1ace7-d3b5-405a-8529-2481e4c99ecf_600x400.jpg 600w"></figure><p>This is an apt metaphor. See, for example, this morning’s NYT article on palm oil affecting jobs in Malaysia. The idea is that European restrictions on palm oil imports cut jobs in Malaysia. Indeed, that is happening. The crunch, like musical chairs, will cost jobs and lives as we move toward <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xr9rIQxwj4">the great simplification</a>.</p><p>Might it not be better for the crunch to be managed within Malaysia than forced from the outside? The resulting action would be much better nuanced to local conditions. But it will be hard for local officials to be agents rather than victims along with their populations. The need to create lifeboats for each community will help clarify the logic.</p><p><em>1.

It’s been awhile.</p><p>I felt a sense of relief. There was no mode I needed to be in, no role I needed to play. I may call a friend for no apparent reason, but meetings on my calendar usually have a subject attached. My conversations with my partner in the evenings usually go back and forth between arranging details of our lives, sharing what happened during the day, and wandering to whatever topic surfaces–childhood memories, wondering what creatures eat our compost at night, or why I feel so passionate about unbranded mens underwear.&nbsp;</p><p>We don’t have enough group conversations that wander and frolic, especially during “working hours.” We are taught about hypotheses and supporting points, starting a meeting with an agenda, and becoming clear on objectives. Yes, and ...</p><blockquote><em>“You do not have conversation to get work done. The conversation is the work.” – David Whyte</em></blockquote><p>The conversation on Tuesday drifted from Jewish mysticism to the language of disagreement to the experience of being lost. No one pulled the discussion toward next steps or productivity. No one was trying to solve a problem or impress each other. We became lost in the current. The laughter and exchange of words would likely have continued if it wasn’t for the clock and the need to return to duty</p><p>I, for one, am questioning duty. There is a time for clarity, focus, and agreements, and there is a time for becoming lost.</p><blockquote><em>“Sometimes the best response to a question is not an answer, it’s bewilderment, the gift of bewilderment. Because what it does is it takes you away from the logic of the question and leads you to other ways of seeing the world. Sometimes we ask questions that invite the specific answers that they are entangled with and we are locked in the cycle of question and answer, question and answer, and nothing breaks that cycle. So we need confusion. As our Elders say, in order to find your way, you must become lost, generously so. When you become lost you will find other ways of being present.” – Bayo Akomolafe</em></blockquote><p>I need more conversations without a topic, discussions without a purpose.&nbsp;</p><hr><figure

other woman came over<br>Handed me a parka and windbreaker<br>Thank you she said<br>We’re off to get the paramedics</p><p>I set out at a rapid pace<br>Which soon had me quite warm<br>I reached the injured woman quickly<br>She was lean and fit in her mid-40s<br>Dressed in a singlet and running shorts<br>She was laying on the wet ground <br>Right beside the creek<br>Her bare arms and legs were exposed<br>To the damp and the chill February air<br>Her lips were blue and her teeth were<br>Chattering so badly I could<br>Hardly understand her when she spoke<br>She was shivering uncontrollably</p><p>I did my best not to appear too alarmed<br>I looked at her feet<br>Saw that her left ankle<br>Was hideously swollen<br>A good two or three times<br>The size of her right one</p><p>Hi I’m Ken and I’m here <br>To get you warm and <br>Keep you company<br>Until the paramedics arrive<br>What’s your name?<br>Despite her violent shivering<br>She managed to stammer Dolores</p><p>Okay Dolores why don’t<br>You put this windbreaker on and<br>With your permission I’m going to<br>Carefully remove your shoes <br>Then I’m going help you<br>Slide your legs into the sleeves <br>Of this parka to help to warm you<br>That will give you some insulation<br>Against the damp ground<br>Which is sucking heat out of you<br>Is that okay with you?</p><p>Just be careful of my ankle please<br>I promise I will be gentle<br>I can see that it’s a bad sprain<br>I managed to untie and <br>Remove her sneakers<br>I carefully guided her feet<br>Into the sleeves of the parka<br>And pulled it up under her<br>So that her lower body <br>Was no longer on the bare ground</p><p>Do you run here often?<br>Several times a week<br>I was on the King Mountain trail<br>(King Mtn is the hill above the canyon)<br>How long have you been laying here?<br>Maybe half an hour or 45 minutes<br>No wonder you’re freezing!</p><p>My husband is gonna kill me <br>When he hears about this!</p><p>Let’s focus on getting you warm<br>Before we worry about your husband<br>I’m concerned about your shivering <br>And the fact that your lips are blue<br>I think I have a way to warm you up<br>Is it okay if I put my hands<br>On the bottom of your feet?<br>I promise not to hurt your ankle</p><p>Anything that will warm me up<br>Is okay with me I’ve never felt so cold!</p><p>I can see that you are quite chilled<br>I am going to do some breathwork<br>You don’t need to do anything<br>You can just relax and if you want<br>You can match your breath to mine</p><p>At this point I’d had about three years<br>Of private chi kung lessons<br>I knew I could generate <br>A lot of heat for myself<br>But I didn’t know if I could<br>Use it to warm up another person</p><p>I knelt down and gently lifted<br>Her feet into my lap<br>Is this okay?<br>She nodded yes<br>I placed my hands flat against<br>The soles of her feet</p><p>I’m just going to breath now<br>My breaths will probably be<br>Too deep to match exactly<br>Why don’t you try taking two breaths <br>For every one of mine?<br>She nodded</p><p>I began to breathe as <br>Deeply as I could<br>Inhaling and exhaling through my nose<br>While focusing on my belly<br>I visualized a blazing fire filling my body<br>With flames moving down my arms</p><p>After about 15 minutes of this<br>Dolores stopped shivering<br>Her lips returned to a normal color</p><p>Oh my god! Oh my god!<br>I don’t know what you are doing<br>But I am completely warm now<br>I feel like I am sitting beside<br>A roaring fire wrapped in a blanket!<br>I am actually starting to sweat!<br>How are you able to do this?<br>This is totally amazing!</p><p>I can’t really explain it Dolores<br>I have been training in an old<br>Chinese art called chi kung<br>It has properties that our way of thinking<br>Lacks adequate language to describe<br>But as you can see it works!</p><p>I could now hear the paramedics<br>They would be there in a minute<br>As I was still quite buzzed<br>I didn’t want to be seen by them</p><p>I’m going to go now Dolores<br>But do me a favor will you?<br>Get yourself a good metal whistle<br>And carry it with you when you run<br>If you had sprained your ankle <br>Up on King Mountain it might<br>Have been hours before anyone <br>Came along to find you<br>You’re lucky you were down here<br>On the canyon path which is<br>Quite well traveled<br>Will you do that?</p><p>That’s a great idea<br>Thank you!</p><p>I’m going to leave you in good hands<br>The paramedics are almost here<br>You take care now<br>I headed off down the trail<br>Just as the paramedics arrived</p><p>Ken Homer • March 2024</p><hr><h2 id="a-few-more-pix">A Few More Pix</h2><p>by <strong>Ken Homer</strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/IMG_3254.jpg" width="1280" height="960" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/IMG_3254.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/IMG_3254.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/IMG_3254.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/IMG_3259.jpg" width="1280" height="960" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/IMG_3259.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/IMG_3259.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/IMG_3259.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/IMG_3260.jpg" width="1280" height="960" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/IMG_3260.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/IMG_3260.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/IMG_3260.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/IMG_5220.jpg" width="1280" height="960" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/IMG_5220.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/IMG_5220.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/IMG_5220.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/IMG_5401.jpg" width="1280" height="960" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/IMG_5401.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/IMG_5401.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/IMG_5401.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/Inverness.jpg" width="1280" height="960" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/03/Inverness.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/03/Inverness.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/Inverness.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><hr><p>Thank you for reading!
