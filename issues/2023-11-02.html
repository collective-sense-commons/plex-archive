Not one size fits all. Maybe not like today at all.</p><p>According to Wikipedia [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-:0-2">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liminality#cite_note-:0-2</a>], “in anthropology <em>liminality</em> (from Latin <em>līmen</em>&nbsp;‘a threshold’) is the quality of ambiguity or disorientation that occurs in the middle stage of a rite of passage, when participants no longer hold their pre-ritual status but have not yet begun the transition . . . During a rite’s liminal stage, participants ‘stand at the threshold’<sup> </sup>between their previous way of structuring their identity, time, or community, and a new way.”&nbsp;</p><p>A lot like the world today.</p><p>At the Conference, we were invited to explore liminality as a ‘space between’ – between the known and the unknown, the inside and outside, that which has been and that which may be. Shared beliefs, possible paths, passages and impasses. Possible promising outcomes, and those less promising. A space between two eras, two ways of thinking, two purposes.&nbsp;</p><p>More than two, of course. Just like possible future<em>s</em>, emerging democrac<em>ies</em>.</p><p>Places for exploring opposites, apposites, and possibilities. Metaphors for reflection before moving forward, prepared or unprepared. As one of the introductory speakers told us, “You can’t feel unprepared for something that doesn’t exist yet”.</p><p>It was autumn in Paris, Paris in the rain.</p><p>Beyond the conference walls, we also looked for some of the liminal spaces of Paris.</p><p>And everywhere, we saw trees.&nbsp;</p><p>They set the frame for how we see.</p><p>We noticed how their branches interweave, like stories leaf to leaf.</p><p>We found them on shopping streets, and in parks and galleries. In the quiet passages, and the charming impasses.</p><p>A tree may lose its leaves, not knowing what the future brings. Or perhaps knowing in ways <em>we</em> don’t yet know. Perhaps they do learn again each autumn about the power of changing.</p><p>We can learn too:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>from the falling leaves the importance of letting go, from the trees the lessons of perseverance and resolve, and learning through the seasons that life always begins again.</blockquote><p><em>[Freely adopted from ‘Leben Lernen,’ by Ute Latendorf:<strong> <a href="https://keb.global/leben-lernen-von-ute-latendorf/"><em>https://keb.global/leben-lernen-von-ute-latendorf/</em></a></strong></em></p><p>We understood there is beauty in the world, now at this threshold, in its impasse and its rites of passage. We found all this and more, among the trees of Paris.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/11/kune-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1998" height="1126" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/kune-1.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/kune-1.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2023/11/kune-1.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/11/kune-1.png 1998w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/11/kune-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1998" height="1126" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/kune-2.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/kune-2.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2023/11/kune-2.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/11/kune-2.png 1998w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/11/kune-3.png" width="1126" height="2000" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/kune-3.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/kune-3.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/11/kune-3.png 1126w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/11/kune-4.png" width="1126" height="2000" loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/kune-4.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/kune-4.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/11/kune-4.png 1126w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/11/kune-5.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/kune-5.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/kune-5.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2023/11/kune-5.png 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/11/kune-5.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">“</span><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Thank You, Thank You, I am in the Green Zone</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">”(detail), Chéri Samba (2020)</span></figcaption></figure><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/11/yiyi.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/yiyi.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/yiyi.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2023/11/yiyi.jpg 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w2400/2023/11/yiyi.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Peter Kaminski</span></figcaption></figure><hr><h2 id="shaping-ai-for-greater-collective-competence-and-contribution">Shaping AI for Greater Collective Competence and Contribution</h2><p>by <strong>Michael Lennon</strong></p><p>Seeking Interviewees for AI Research<strong>: Shaping AI for Greater Collective Competence and Contribution</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WHO?</strong><br>A Team of highly experienced action researchers and technologists is investigating generative AI’s capacity for amplifying collective competence.&nbsp; We seek to interview&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Early adopters of AI, Entrepreneurs, Developers, Tech influencers,<br>Activists and/or organizational practitioners</strong></p><p>interested in shaping the <strong><em>frontiers of prosocial AI use for collective venturing and performance.</em></strong></p><p><strong>WHY NOW?<br>Recent AI performance research published by Harvard Business School shows elite knowledge workers improve <em>the quality</em> of their individual performance by up to 40%.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Hidden in this research is a systemic blind spot about the performance frontiers of knowledge work.

Another thing I know: this mess will not be resolved by adjudication of fact , but only by acknowledgment of the mutual pain, and perhaps by willingness to accept a bit more pain now (a different kind of pain—a surrender of part of a narrative identity) in hopes of much less pain (the physical suffering and terror that we see all around us right now) in the future.</p><p>As Jane puts it, "Until you can speak the pain of the other to the other, such that they are moved to tears by the depth of your understanding of their pain, trust—and peace—is not truly possible.”</p><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/11/fountain-sunset.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="964" height="1280" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/fountain-sunset.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/11/fountain-sunset.jpg 964w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Peter Kaminski</span></figcaption></figure><hr><h2 id="now-testing-the-living-between-worlds-ai">Now Testing: The Living Between Worlds AI</h2><p>by <strong>Gil Friend</strong></p><p>We’ve been training and testing a new AI on four years of Living Between Worlds videos.</p><p>Here’s my first interaction with it:</p><blockquote>What’s the central theme of this video series?</blockquote><blockquote><em>The central theme of Gil Friend</em>’<em>s Living Between Worlds video series is to explore how to live in this time with dignity, grace, and power between worlds. The series seeks to foster an inquiry into how to interact with each other, both friends and foes, and to cultivate our tribes and our worlds. The series also seeks to challenge ourselves to think and feel beyond the nature/culture partition which has imposed itself everywhere, and to recognize that we are creatures of the planet Terra living with the myriad other creatures on this planet. Ultimately, the series seeks to move from a world in which life is the servant of business to a world in which business is in the service of life.</em></blockquote><p>Not bad at all for starters!</p><p>Please let me know if you have questions you’d like me to ask it.

So I had some thoughts on what to ask my AI partner.</p><h3 id="klaus">Klaus:</h3><p>There is a great deal of angst in the intellectual circles focused on AI, and the risks to our species by AI programs moving beyond the control of humans. All sort of doomsday scenarios what an AI could do to bring harm and subjugate humans. My thoughts are that we are in a symbiotic relationship with whatever AI advances into, because we do share a planet that at its core is Gaia, a living biosphere that makes this rock habitable. Tragically humanity has degraded this biosphere and set in motion transformative disruptions that are already creating a new reality. But at the same time, only humanity can move to mitigate the worst impact, and adapt to a new reality. At current state, our species is incapable to collaborate at the scale required to create peace amongst each other, and to refocus the energy of humanity on living within our respective biospheres, restoring them back to health, creating a sustainable future. With AI itself depending on the success of this transition, what could this symbiosis look like, how could it work. Are there organizational structures to consider. Write a response to these questions, express most up to date thinking in AI.</p><h3 id="chatgpt">ChatGPT:</h3><p>Your musings touch on some deep philosophical, ecological, and technological currents that are very much at the forefront of contemporary thought. Your perspective that humans and AI are in a symbiotic relationship with the Earth’s biosphere (Gaia) adds a layer of complexity to the ongoing debates around AI safety and ethics. I’ll try to address these questions through the most up-to-date understanding of AI and considering your call for a more sustainable future.</p><h3 id="ai-human-symbiosis">AI-Human Symbiosis</h3><ol><li><strong>Shared Goals</strong>: The symbiosis could begin with AI systems that are programmed to prioritize not just specific tasks but also the well-being of the biosphere. AI systems could be tailored to provide solutions to environmental problems, like carbon capture, waste management, and energy efficiency.</li><li><strong>Ethics &amp; Values</strong>: For AI to truly act as a symbiotic partner, ethical frameworks would need to be developed. These could be rooted in universally accepted principles, including those based on religious or philosophical guidelines. Tolstoy, in his “Letter to a Hindu,” emphasized the importance of non-violence and love as the underlying principles that should guide humanity. These could also inform AI development, ensuring that AI decisions aim for the most non-intrusive, non-destructive outcomes.</li><li><strong>Decentralized Control</strong>: A model similar to blockchain could offer a decentralized method of oversight, where no single entity has total control over an AI system. This could mitigate risks and distribute benefits more equitably.</li></ol><h3 id="communication">Communication</h3><p>In the vein of Spiral Dynamics, communication about this partnership could differ based on the target audience:</p><ul><li><strong>Blue</strong>: For those adhering to traditional values, tying the ethical framework of AI symbiosis to religious or conventional principles might resonate.</li><li><strong>Orange</strong>: For a more capitalist or entrepreneurial audience, focus on how AI symbiosis can also lead to more efficient systems, potentially driving down costs and driving up profits, albeit sustainably.</li><li><strong>Green</strong>: Emphasize the collective benefits, social equity, and environmental sustainability that AI can help achieve.</li></ul><h3 id="organizational-structures">Organizational Structures</h3><ol><li><strong>Global AI Ethics Council</strong>: This body could provide oversight and ensure the ethical implementation of AI in various industries. It would comprise experts from multiple fields including ecology, technology, ethics, and social sciences.</li><li><strong>Local Governance</strong>: AI systems tailored for specific ecosystems could be managed by local governments or communities, ensuring that the symbiosis is contextually relevant.</li><li><strong>Public-Private Partnerships</strong>: Collaboration between governments, corporations, and civil society could fast-track the development of symbiotic AI.</li></ol><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>In the same way humanity must heed the urgency of the environmental situation, we should treat the relationship with AI as similarly urgent, existential, and morally guided. As far as confidence ratings go, I’d place this at around 80%. Many of the ideas mentioned are still being debated and are dependent on numerous variables, including technological advancements and sociopolitical shifts.</p><p>Your perspective that this is not just a technological challenge but also a social engineering problem is keen. It’s one of the grand challenges of our time, and AI could either be a partner in solving it or a hindrance, depending on how we approach it.</p><h3 id="klaus-1">Klaus:</h3><p>do you agree that there is indeed a mutual dependency, mechanical life cannot exist without a biosphere</p><h3 id="chatgpt-1">ChatGPT:</h3><p>Yes, under the current technological paradigm, there’s a compelling case to be made for a mutual dependency between mechanical life (e.g., AI and robotics) and the Earth’s biosphere.</p><p>Firstly, the materials that are required to create hardware for AI and robotics, such as rare earth minerals, metals, and even the energy sources powering these devices, are extracted from the Earth. The extraction and processing of these materials have environmental impacts, implicating the health of the biosphere.</p><p>Secondly, current AI and mechanical systems require energy to function, most of which is generated using fossil fuels, thereby contributing to climate change. A degraded biosphere impacts climate stability, water cycles, and other factors that indirectly but fundamentally could affect the ‘health’ and maintenance of mechanical systems.</p><p>Thirdly, AI is fundamentally a creation of biological life—humans, in this case. The data it uses to learn and improve comes from human activities and the natural world. If the biosphere is compromised to the point where human life can’t sustain itself, the creation and maintenance of AI and mechanical life would also be jeopardized.</p><p>Based on these points, I’d say my confidence level in the assertion of mutual dependency is around 90%. There’s an ongoing interplay that makes mechanical life reliant on the Earth’s biosphere in multiple ways. However, this could change as technology advances, especially if new forms of sustainable energy are developed, or if AI and robotics are adapted to function in non-Earth environments. But for now, the symbiotic relationship seems quite clear.</p><h3 id="klaus-2">Klaus:</h3><p>The basis of collaboration has to be trust, we are working from so many different directions that only trust in each other’s good intentions can facilitate partnering across the many silos of specialization. It may take on a different context for each color: reciprocal altruism, believe in a higher power, morality. For our Christian brothers and sisters, the command couldn’t be more clear. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+2&amp;version=NIV" rel="noopener noreferrer">1 John 2</a></p><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/11/reflecting-pool.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/11/reflecting-pool.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/11/reflecting-pool.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2023/11/reflecting-pool.jpg 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w2400/2023/11/reflecting-pool.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Peter Kaminski</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-civilizational-level">The Civilizational Level</h2><p>by <strong>Douglass Carmichael</strong></p><p>Most climate discussion is either a discussion of why we are in a ditch, plans that have no discussion of implementation.

But what is left out is the social side of actual climate change.
