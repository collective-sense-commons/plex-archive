Too much to review, but one of the most inspiring but also frightening stories was of the <strong>GEN Ukraine</strong> group and the support they got from the Danish network to fund helping thousands of their displaced countrymen settle in the countryside temporarily–or not-so-temporarily, learn some gardening, and find a new way of life.</p><p>As a group, there was an overall sense that “What if we were right all along” about ecovillages being the only viable way of life, and “We are not prepared for what is already upon us”. The atmosphere was celebratory though the gravity of the situation was clear.</p><p>The <strong><a href="https://genukraine.com.ua/index.php/en/">GEN Ukraine</a></strong> group is looking to build housing before the winter hits, so if you are interested in helping with the effort, please reach out to them.
