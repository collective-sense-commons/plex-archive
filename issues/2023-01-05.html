Sebastian is a Swedish filmmaker working with Chef Jos√© Andr√©s of World Central Kitchen, living in Kyiv right now. The group is raising money via Kickstarter: <strong><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seblindstrom/candles-for-ukraine-in-times-of-electricity-blackouts">Candles for Ukraine in times of electricity blackouts.</a></strong></p><p>A message from Sebastian:</p><blockquote>Why do we bring candles to people ? Everyone has candles at home but they are low quality, burn fast and the good ones cost too much .. too hard to find. We will gift candles to people as surprises when they sit on a train going to a place with little or low electricity. It will be the most amazing candle they have ever seen, with an amazing message of Ukrainian pride. "The real light is in the heart of every Ukrainian". Blue and yellow. 90 hours of light, unheard of ! So.. these candles üïØÔ∏è are a surprise gift to people who are traveling home at a dark moment in their life.. a reminder that they are not alone.</blockquote><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/01/2023-01-04-23.00.52.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1280" height="960" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/2023-01-04-23.00.52.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/01/2023-01-04-23.00.52.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/01/2023-01-04-23.00.52.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>charles blass</figcaption></figure><hr><h2 id="language-landscape-and-light">Language, Landscape and Light</h2><p>by <strong>Hank Kune</strong></p><p>Speculations on light, landscape and language to greet a new year.</p><p>At this time of year light is so important, here on the west coast of Ireland.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/01/image-3.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="936" height="702" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/image-3.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/01/image-3.png 936w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Hank Kune</figcaption></figure><p>We see how it illuminates and enlivens things, provoking and disrupting shadows, welcoming new understandings of the world.

Most mornings it rains, or threatens to rain; and rain-light keeps the landscape near. Then in the afternoons it clears.</p><p>Last light is lovely, it's the best, showing off the winter colors of the west: amber, mauve, red and many wintry greens. Light makes the world a beautiful thing.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/01/image-6.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="936" height="702" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/image-6.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/01/image-6.png 936w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Hank Kune</figcaption></figure><p>I have just started reading a fascinating book about the Irish landscape and the Irish language: <strong>32 Words for Field.</strong></p><p>It describes the way Irish speakers (from thousands of years ago, until recently) encoded their acquired knowledge, learnings, wisdom, insights and poetry in a language describing specific elements of landscape, differentiating dozens of nuances in nature and culture by naming them, a new word for each idea separately: 32 kinds of fields, 18 kinds of holes, 16 words for orienting yourself by the sun, 9 words for waves ...</p><p>A hole made by a spade in the earth, a hole made by water eroding a stone, a hole made by a lobster burrowing for safety in the sand, a hole made by needle pricking fabric, another for a needle pricking skin.</p><p>A field with right angles, a field where gorse once grew and was removed by burning, another such field where gorse was cut by scythe, a sheltered field where a mare may have its foal, a field for cows before milking.</p><p>Lessons of nature and culture (the world worked by human hands) passed down through generations and centuries. Essential ways of reading landscapes, of negotiating with worlds natural and man-made by looking at things and really seeing what is there, and once seeing them dancing with words through the world.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/01/image-7.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="936" height="702" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/image-7.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/01/image-7.png 936w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Hank Kune</figcaption></figure><p>This language is vanishing with the last fluent Irish speakers, vanishing along with our capacity to discern 'difference', and an interest in making this distinction. Today we seem to live by lumping things together without paying much attention to difference. Using categories to ignore (or avoid) trying to express clearly - or poetically - what we want to say. ‚ÄúKeyword thinking‚Äù, as my sister Beverly, who runs Creative Alternatives in New Mexico, calls it, ‚Äúmaking our experience of the world more mundane‚Äù.</p><p>A shaman she knew once told her about ‚Äòseeing things as if we could hear them speak‚Äô. An almost-lost art now. Curiosity, it seems, may be going the same way. ‚ÄúTaking time for curiosity is no longer the norm‚Äù.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/01/image-9.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="936" height="702" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/image-9.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/01/image-9.png 936w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Hank Kune</figcaption></figure><p>In Irish, many of these words are very old (just as the worn-down mountains and rounded hills of County Mayo). Some go back many thousands of years (although scholars don't all agree on how many).</p><p>As Manch√°n Magan tells us in his book, there is an old Irish saying: "Three times the lifespan of a whale is the lifespan of a ridge, three times the lifespan of a ridge is the lifespan of the world". Ancient Irish people saw the whale as living for 1,000 years. That made the ridges 3,000 years old - corresponding to the beginning of cultivated crops in Ireland - and the lifespan of the 'world' as 9,000 years, corresponding to the first appearance of people on this island.</p><p>A lot of time encapsulated in a single saying, related to a landscape of agricultural ridges which can still be seen today, not 20 kilometers from where I am writing.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/01/image-10.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="936" height="702" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/image-10.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/01/image-10.png 936w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Hank Kune</figcaption></figure><p>This language of landscape contains the power to enchant us and draw us in; or refuse us and keep us out. We often refer to the powers of landscape. In some cultures, the words are still here, even though the perceived need for noticing is no longer so strong.</p><p>How much do we 'need' to notice when navigating through today‚Äôs uncertainties, or tomorrow‚Äôs ambiguity? Can we notice our way into the book of the world, into a library of alternative worlds, ¬†a range of ‚Äúadjacent possibles"? How much light do we need to see them?</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/01/image-11.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="936" height="702" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/image-11.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/01/image-11.png 936w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Hank Kune</figcaption></figure><p>I know a number of places where light does special things to landscapes. Both northern New Mexico and the west of Ireland are magical landscapes for me, the one wet and chilly, the other hot and high. Does an old language of landscape also exist in northern New Mexico? In native American languages not yet lost today?</p><p>Beverly again:</p><p>‚ÄúWe do have terms for different types of snow to differentiate an early winter snow (a <em>male</em> snow, very dry and powdery) from a late winter/early spring snow (a <em>female</em> snow, very wet and heavy); a word for rain that doesn‚Äôt quite touch the ground (<em>virga</em>), a word for snow that comes down in pellet form (<em>hominy snow</em> or <em>grapple</em>) and different color descriptors for light to describe times of day, or weather or seasonal variations. For example if the light turns yellow (even in the middle of the night) it means that a snowstorm is about to begin. The light outside my window now is lead gray, as opposed to steel gray, soft gray, or iron gray, all of which mean different things in terms of imminent weather‚Äù.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/01/image-12.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="702" height="936" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/image-12.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/01/image-12.png 702w"><figcaption>Hank Kune</figcaption></figure><p>Does this language of environments and light exist in other places? The songlines of Australia come to mind. Does it exist even in cities? In images from telescopes like the James Webb, plotting the light of the cosmos? In the emerging metaverse? What roles does light play there?</p><p>Considering how important light on our or planet is, is there a universal language of light? We know about Goethe‚Äôs language of light (conceived as experiences of the eye), and Isaac Newton‚Äôs (which denied the need of an eye). Are there existing lexicons of landscape and light used by peoples today, and lessons to be learned from them about the value of paying attention to where we stand, where we think we are going, where we want to go ‚Äî and what it looks like there. Lessons about enhancing our understanding of how the world works, about recovering our capacity to see and celebrate difference?</p><p>32 kinds of fields, 24 kinds of clouds, 18 varieties of roads, how many words for waves and hillsides and snow, and what rain does as it touches down on water, earth, roads, and the human imagination.</p><p>And why it may matter.</p><p>Speculations for a new year.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/01/image-13.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="936" height="702" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/image-13.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/01/image-13.png 936w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Hank Kune</figcaption></figure><p>As all roads lead to futures, may ours lead to the light.</p><p>All the best for a happy and inspiring 2023!</p><p>~ <strong>Hank Kune</strong></p><p>[With thanks to <strong>Manch√°n Magan,</strong> <strong>Beverly Kune,</strong> and <strong>Steve Smith</strong>]</p><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-video-card kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-video-container"><video src="__GHOST_URL__/content/media/2023/01/2023-01-04-23.00.47.mp4" poster="https://img.spacergif.org/v1/624x848/0a/spacer.png" width="624" height="848" loop autoplay muted playsinline preload="metadata" style="background: transparent url('__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/01/media-thumbnail-ember2455.jpg') 50% 50% / cover no-repeat;" /></video><div class="kg-video-overlay"><button class="kg-video-large-play-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z"/></svg></button></div><div class="kg-video-player-container kg-video-hide"><div class="kg-video-player"><button class="kg-video-play-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z"/></svg></button><button class="kg-video-pause-icon kg-video-hide"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><rect x="3" y="1" width="7" height="22" rx="1.5" ry="1.5"/><rect x="14" y="1" width="7" height="22" rx="1.5" ry="1.5"/></svg></button><span class="kg-video-current-time">0:00</span><div class="kg-video-time">/<span class="kg-video-duration"></span></div><input type="range" class="kg-video-seek-slider" max="100" value="0"><button class="kg-video-playback-rate">1&#215;</button><button class="kg-video-unmute-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M15.189 2.021a9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h1.794a.249.249 0 0 1 .221.133 9.73 9.73 0 0 0 7.924 4.85h.06a1 1 0 0 0 1-1V3.02a1 1 0 0 0-1.06-.998Z"/></svg></button><button class="kg-video-mute-icon kg-video-hide"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M16.177 4.3a.248.248 0 0 0 .073-.176v-1.1a1 1 0 0 0-1.061-1 9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h.114a.251.251 0 0 0 .177-.073ZM23.707 1.706A1 1 0 0 0 22.293.292l-22 22a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.414l.009.009a1 1 0 0 0 1.405-.009l6.63-6.631A.251.251 0 0 1 8.515 17a.245.245 0 0 1 .177.075 10.081 10.081 0 0 0 6.5 2.92 1 1 0 0 0 1.061-1V9.266a.247.247 0 0 1 .073-.176Z"/></svg></button><input type="range" class="kg-video-volume-slider" max="100" value="100"></div></div></div><figcaption>charles blass</figcaption></figure><hr><h2 id="turn-of-the-phase-wisdom-jam-afterflow-with-ward-cunningham-potpourri-%E2%80%9823">Turn of the Phase: Wisdom Jam Afterflow with Ward Cunningham + Potpourri ‚Äò23</h2><p>by <strong>charles blass</strong></p><p>HNY &amp;

(Tom was also mentioned in the <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2022-11-16" rel="noopener noreferrer">16 November Plex newsletter</a>, in Charles &amp; Peter's co-debrief of the <strong>Community Wisdom Gardening</strong> event.)<br><br>In the past few years, a new board has been hard at work to grow the <strong>Co-Intelligence Institute</strong> (CII), the small nonprofit Tom founded. The new board, with members from age 30s to 70s, along with other associates have been mostly heads-down this year, and this work has now borne some fruit we can announce publicly:<br><br>First of all, we have a brand new website, at a new URL -</p><p><a href="http://co-intelligence.institute/" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://co-intelligence.institute/</a><br><br>It highlights three areas of focus for the Institute's past and future work promoting and developing co-intelligence, with each area having plenty to dig into. For example, our <a href="https://www.co-intelligence.institute/community" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learning Community page</a> points to many public events, including a recent Real World Co-Intelligence call, <em>Exploring the Austrian Climate Assembly</em> (a call recording is available). This was a deep learning experience for many who attended including the presenters, who appreciated the opportunity to see their own work in a broader context.<br><br>Institute Associate <strong>Rosa Zubizarreta</strong> is the lead organizer of these calls. As she wrote in a <a href="https://madmimi.com/p/9f59351" rel="noopener noreferrer">CII newsletter</a>, she came across the work of the <a href="https://medium.com/reimagining-the-civic-commons" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reimagining the Civic Commons</a> movement at a recent "Reimagining Democracy" conference, and our January Real World Co-Intelligence call will feature a speaker from that world. If you're interested, you can <a href="https://forms.gle/nsaehHCtBLzsYo318" rel="noopener noreferrer">sign up to get an email</a> whenever these monthly calls are announced. Other upcoming events on our Learning Community page include a four-session book group, and a patterning ritual for the New Year.<br><br>Another thread of our work is transformational storytelling. We showcase some case studies on the <a href="https://www.co-intelligence.institute/examples" rel="noopener noreferrer">Real-World Examples page</a>. These include classics such as the Maclean's magazine 1991 <a href="https://www.co-intelligence.institute/case-study-macleans" rel="noopener noreferrer">"People's Verdict Experiment"</a> (including links to the 1999 interviews Tom commissioned). Also a very up-to-date article by CII board member <strong>Andy Paice,</strong> <a href="https://www.co-intelligence.institute/case-study-polis-climate-council" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Polis &amp; the Austrian Citizens‚Äô Climate Council."</a> And the <a href="https://www.co-intelligence.institute/case-study-vtaiwan" rel="noopener noreferrer">2015 use of Pol.is by vTaiwan</a> which achieved a broad consensus among both traditional taxi and Uber drivers.<br><br>On the <a href="https://www.co-intelligence.institute/tools" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tools page</a>, we offer a large sampling of group processes, organizations &amp; organizing methodologies, and politics &amp; governance resources which exemplify co-intelligence. Featured is the <strong>Wise Democracy Pattern Language</strong> cards, developed by Tom Atlee and CII Associate <strong>Martin Rausch.</strong> Among many other resources we also include a link to <a href="https://www.co-intelligence.institute/dynamic-facilitation" rel="noopener noreferrer">the story of CII's lengthy involvement with Dynamic Facilitation</a> as a sense-making social technology, including how it spread to Europe and its uptake in Austria in particular.<br><br>As with most nonprofits this time of year, we are fundraising to continue and expand our work in 2023.

Because of this reality, it begs the question: If we aren‚Äôt currently experiencing true AI, then how can we categorize the current state of advanced algorithms and technology? The answer is simple. Right now, we‚Äôre living in the era of <em>augmented intelligence</em>.</p><p><a href="https://bdtechtalks.com/2017/12/04/what-is-the-difference-between-ai-and-augmented-intelligence/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Augmented intelligence</a> (AI), also referred to as intelligence augmentation (IA) and cognitive augmentation, is a complement‚Äînot a replacement‚Äîto human intelligence. It‚Äôs about helping humans become faster and smarter at the tasks they‚Äôre performing. At its core, augmented intelligence is not technically different from what‚Äôs already being presented as AI. It is a rather different perspective on technological advances, especially those that allow computers and software to participate in tasks that were thought to be the exclusive to humans.</p><p>The reason I think this is an important distinction is its influence on the design phase. Social systems change requires people changing their mind, enabling behavioral adaptations. Instead of 'artificial' intelligence outlining what must be done, augmented intelligence will inform and create a deeper understanding of the as is scenarios facing humanity on an emotional level where change happens. </p><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/01/2023-01-04-23.00.44.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="960" height="1280" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/01/2023-01-04-23.00.44.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/01/2023-01-04-23.00.44.jpg 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>charles blass</figcaption></figure><hr><h2 id="lionsberg-first-meeting-of-the-new-year">Lionsberg First Meeting of the New Year</h2><p>by <strong>Jordan Sukut</strong></p><p>Bottom line up front: We are still here.

We will be closing all previous threads, resetting meeting agendas, functions, etc. for the new year, and starting ‚Äúas if‚Äù from a clean slate and building up the core functions and components of the System and Movement 1 by 1 with quality and care. This is where we shift from exploring the Meta Project conceptually and building systems, infrastructure and processes (2017 to 2022), to actually building the serving and enabling organization to empower it to sustainably rise (2023).</p><p>We will differentiate out into two groups ‚Äì Lionsberg members, who will have internal access to weekly content, meetings, networks, data sets, recordings, interviews, etc.; and friends who prefer to follow along from afar via a public facing monthly newsletter.</p><p>I hope to see you soon within the boundaries of the mythical and magical land of Lionsberg üòä It‚Äôs time to see if the small starting point we are holding in our collective hands can start rolling down the mountain and exponentially gain steam in 2023.

We will be tracking those for practitioners, donors, catalytic investors, local governments, policy makers at the federal level and think tanks, analysts, and local and sector focused media.</p><p>We will partner with related initiatives once we get it up and running. We want to point to what is newly possible to create economic justice in your town, based on real and relevant examples.</p><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-video-card kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-video-container"><video src="__GHOST_URL__/content/media/2023/01/2023-01-04-23.01.01.mp4" poster="https://img.spacergif.org/v1/624x832/0a/spacer.png" width="624" height="832" loop autoplay muted playsinline preload="metadata" style="background: transparent url('__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/01/media-thumbnail-ember2542.jpg') 50% 50% / cover no-repeat;" /></video><div class="kg-video-overlay"><button class="kg-video-large-play-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z"/></svg></button></div><div class="kg-video-player-container kg-video-hide"><div class="kg-video-player"><button class="kg-video-play-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z"/></svg></button><button class="kg-video-pause-icon kg-video-hide"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><rect x="3" y="1" width="7" height="22" rx="1.5" ry="1.5"/><rect x="14" y="1" width="7" height="22" rx="1.5" ry="1.5"/></svg></button><span class="kg-video-current-time">0:00</span><div class="kg-video-time">/<span class="kg-video-duration"></span></div><input type="range" class="kg-video-seek-slider" max="100" value="0"><button class="kg-video-playback-rate">1&#215;</button><button class="kg-video-unmute-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M15.189 2.021a9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h1.794a.249.249 0 0 1 .221.133 9.73 9.73 0 0 0 7.924 4.85h.06a1 1 0 0 0 1-1V3.02a1 1 0 0 0-1.06-.998Z"/></svg></button><button class="kg-video-mute-icon kg-video-hide"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M16.177 4.3a.248.248 0 0 0 .073-.176v-1.1a1 1 0 0 0-1.061-1 9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h.114a.251.251 0 0 0 .177-.073ZM23.707 1.706A1 1 0 0 0 22.293.292l-22 22a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.414l.009.009a1 1 0 0 0 1.405-.009l6.63-6.631A.251.251 0 0 1 8.515 17a.245.245 0 0 1 .177.075 10.081 10.081 0 0 0 6.5 2.92 1 1 0 0 0 1.061-1V9.266a.247.247 0 0 1 .073-.176Z"/></svg></button><input type="range" class="kg-video-volume-slider" max="100" value="100"></div></div></div><figcaption>charles blass</figcaption></figure><hr><p><strong><strong><strong><strong>Thank you for reading! </strong></strong></strong></strong>Next edition will be published on 18 January 2023.
