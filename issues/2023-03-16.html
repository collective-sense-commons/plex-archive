This site is still evolving. So far, I've been working alone to  add my own artifacts and to create a framework for all the pieces. Now it is ready for your contributions! I invite your exploration and welcome additional resources, discussions, projects, or collaborations. What do you think is most important here for our community?  What do you think is missing?  What could you add?  Please <a href="mailto:wendy@everyoneswisdom.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact me</a> with any thoughts.</p><p>The other is an Ecosystem Map on Miro, called <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPlpxoeM=/?share_link_id=149420567606&amp;ref=biweekly-plex-dispatch" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toward a Collaborative Ecosystem</a>, now also available from the <a href="https://www.everyoneswisdom.com/">Everyone’s Wisdom website</a>.

And yet, it has already begun to galvanize and generate momentum toward more collaborative efforts.  What do you get from it?</p><p>Please note, both are a work in progress. While both are available for sharing, both will also continue to evolve and be open to collaboration.  I invite you to explore and reach out to me with any insights that are in service to you and/or the whole at <a href="mailto:wendy@everyoneswisdom.com" rel="noopener noreferrer">wendy@everyoneswisdom.com</a>.</p><p>Next up:  Working in collaboration with <strong>Vincent Arena</strong> and his brilliance on <strong><a href="https://catalist.network/">Catalist</a></strong>, we are even closer to scaling these resourcing and mapping efforts inside the Trove feature. Soon we are hoping to enable the curators and mappers among us to benefit from and collaborate on a shared repository.  More on this to come!</p><hr><h2 id="around-town">Around Town</h2><p>by <strong>Ken Homer</strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/03/IMG_7017.jpg" width="1280" height="504" loading="lazy" alt srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/IMG_7017.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/IMG_7017.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/03/IMG_7017.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/03/IMG_7058.jpg" width="1280" height="960" loading="lazy" alt srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/IMG_7058.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/IMG_7058.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/03/IMG_7058.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/03/IMG_0184.jpg" width="1280" height="816" loading="lazy" alt srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/IMG_0184.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/IMG_0184.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/03/IMG_0184.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/03/Cooldge-Arcade.jpg" width="1280" height="960" loading="lazy" alt srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/Cooldge-Arcade.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2023/03/Cooldge-Arcade.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/03/Cooldge-Arcade.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div><figcaption>Angelique Benicio’s “Blue Midnight”, Shine On Harvest Moon, Celebrating Creativity, Coolidge Arcade – photos by Ken Homer</figcaption></figure><hr><h2 id="toward-a-world-that-cherishes-the-well-being-of-all">Toward a World That Cherishes the Well-Being of All</h2><p>by <strong>Jordan Sukut</strong></p><p><em>[ed. note: This is from an internal, but not private, </em><a href="https://lionsberg.wiki/lionsberg_wiki_blogs/jordan_nicholas/above_the_chaos,_a_note_to_the_first_50"><em>blog post for the Lionsberg </em>“<em>First 50</em>”</a><em>.

Our shared <strong><strong>Vision</strong></strong> and <strong><strong>Goal</strong></strong>, the <strong><strong>North Star</strong></strong> that guides us, remains unchanged, and our commitment to this <strong><strong>Quest</strong></strong> is more steadfast than ever.</p><p>The vision is bold.<br>The path is transformative.<br>The goal is transcendent.<br>The plan is wise.<br>It still might work. The next steps are challenging, but we’ll overcome them.</p><p>At the outset of this year, we set a <strong><strong>120 day plan</strong></strong> to secure resources for the next stage. With ~45 days remaining, I am acutely aware that we cannot bring our audacious vision to life without additional resources, participation, and support. As such, I am embarking on an exhilarating mission the next 45 days to secure the necessary support that will propel our collective efforts to new heights.</p><p>While I focus on gathering the resources needed for our next steps, I am going to hold off on convening additional meetings except as strictly necessary to advance the critical path. Your expertise, connections, and passion are invaluable during this critical phase, and I invite you to contribute in the following ways:</p><ol><li><strong><strong>Speaking, panel, or podcasting appearances</strong></strong> - Please share any opportunities to speak or participate in podcasts or panels that will allow us to spread our message and inspire a wider audience.</li><li><strong><strong>Resources + All Forms of Capital</strong></strong> - Please connect us with potential supporters who share our vision of a brighter future, and have access to resources (financial or otherwise).</li><li><strong><strong>Targeted Meetings With High Net Worth Individuals or Foundations</strong></strong> - Please help us engage with visionary high net worth individuals or foundations who share our passion and might want to support our next steps.</li><li><strong><strong>Amplification</strong></strong> - Please advocate for the <a href="https://lionsberg.wiki/New_Vision_and_Plan.html">New Vision and Plan</a> by commenting, supporting, or amplifying our cause through emails or social media posts, spreading our message with enthusiasm and conviction.</li><li><strong><strong>Community Building and Networking</strong></strong> - Actively engage in building and nurturing a diverse community of passionate individuals, thought leaders, and organizations aligned with our shared <strong><strong>Vision</strong></strong>. Leverage your personal and professional networks to create meaningful connections and collaborations that will enhance and accelerate our collective impact.</li></ol><p>Your ongoing support and dedication are the lifeblood of our shared vision. Together, we can ignite a movement that transcends the chaos, paving the way for a world that cherishes the well-being of all and celebrates our collective potential.</p><p>Thank you for your commitment and belief in our mission. With your help, we will secure the resources necessary to catapult our movement forward and make a lasting, transformative impact on the world.</p><p>I have recently published a couple books - please feel free to explore and forward:</p><ul><li><a href="https://lionsberg.wiki/Lionsberg_Wiki_Books/Beyond_The_Meta_Crisis/Beyond_The_Meta_Crisis_-_A_Blueprint_for_a_Better_Future.html">Beyond The Meta Crisis - A Blueprint for a Better Future</a></li><li><a href="https://lionsberg.wiki/Lionsberg_Wiki_Books/A_New_American_Revolution_-_A_Vision_for_a_Stronger,_Freer,_and_More_United_Nation/A_New_American_Revolution_-_A_Vision_for_a_Stronger,_Freer,_and_More_United_Nation.html">A New American Revolution - A Vision for a Stronger, Freer, and More United Nation</a></li></ul><p>With heartfelt gratitude and unwavering determination,</p><p>~ J</p><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/03/2023-03-15-23.23.27.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="960" height="1280" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2023/03/2023-03-15-23.23.27.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/03/2023-03-15-23.23.27.jpg 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>charles blass</figcaption></figure><hr><p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Thank you for reading!</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> The next edition will be published on 5 April 2023.
