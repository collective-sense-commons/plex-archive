When I went to the University of Rochester as an undergrad it was as much to study flute at the Eastman School of Music, as for the science, as a Bausch &amp; Lomb Scholar, majoring in Chemistry.</p><p>I began chalk pastel portraiture of the children of a summer boss, and continued chalk portraiture during my undergrad and PhD. During my professional life, as an industrial chemist (polymer chemistry), then management, followed by global technology leadership with labs across the globe, art took a backseat to work, family, and science leadership in the American Chemical Society (ACS), Division of Polymer Chemistry.</p><p>After retirement, my science shifted to National Committee leadership, ACS Board of Directors, and Chair of the Board of Directors, while my art shifted to water colors, which I continue to enjoy.

The <a href="https://www.voiceofhumanity.one/reputation-economy-simulation/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sufficiency Currency experiment</a> did not take place– we weren't able to generate enough physical participants to justify the event. The learnings were:</p><ul><li>Get a team in place.</li><li>Have a local project manager.</li><li>Simplify the game in terms of the administration required in each round.</li><li>Adjust the game for the communities that the founders belong to.</li></ul><p>The two spawned activities are:</p><ul><li>Emergence of people who want to participate in a few more game online simulations to see how we can simplify it. <strong>Spirit</strong> will be participating/organizing along with me to figure out how we can do that. We have good feedback from the first players and are happy to have anyone participate.</li><li><a href="https://www.voiceofhumanity.one/priceless-economics/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Collaboration with two cofounders and the launch of the Priceless</a> experimentation project. I realized what we are really doing is a lot of experiments rather than a startup with pivots. Priceless is looking at bringing together programmers (for example displaced Ukrainians with software development background) to live in ecological-living-working centers to develop Web3/GameB software that will allow us to do some experiments in different communities. We are already talking to someone who wants to sponsor a location in Slovenia, the ecovillage in Navarra has space for 5-10 adults if we can find some EU funding, and we are looking at creating an operational plan for the Kenyan “sister” location already. We're also looking at being featured in a 100-startups project showcase in the autumn. This evolution of the project has gained momentum very rapidly.</li></ul><p>Exciting times for Voice of Humanity!</p><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/05/energy-soup--an-ann-wigmore-recipe-.jpg" width="960" height="1280" loading="lazy" alt srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/energy-soup--an-ann-wigmore-recipe-.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/05/energy-soup--an-ann-wigmore-recipe-.jpg 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/05/karma.jpg" width="960" height="1280" loading="lazy" alt srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/karma.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/05/karma.jpg 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/05/swissness-2.jpg" width="960" height="1280" loading="lazy" alt srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/swissness-2.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/05/swissness-2.jpg 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div><figcaption>photos by charles blass</figcaption></figure><p>“energy soup (an ann wigmore recipe)”<br>“karma”<br> “swissness 2”</p><hr><h2 id="conversations-about-midcentury">Conversations about Midcentury</h2><p>by <strong>Hank Kune</strong></p><p>What are the futures people really want – and are committed to work towards? These days there is a lot of talk about this, and about how can we bring the diverse perspectives together – and especially the ideas of the ‘unheard third’ of society – our elders (so often consigned to mere grandparenting after retiring from professional work) and young people (rarely paid attention to by society’s decision-makers, at least until they reach the age to vote).</p><p>During the first week of June, <strong>Time’s Arrow &amp; Future Voices</strong> will initiate a multigenerational dialogue about climate change, the environment, and what people want the world to be like at Midcentury.</p><p>During the week of activities around <strong>Stockholm+50</strong> and <strong>World Environment Day</strong> (2<sup>nd</sup> – 5<sup>th</sup> June) several dinners and dedicated sessions on these themes will be held, and the results of these sessions – combined with the output of the <a href="https://en.framtidensroster.org/">Future Voices</a> program and other related workshops – will be presented on World Environment Day, June 5<sup>th</sup>.</p><p>Our intention is to use this ‘moment’ to launch a series of intergenerational dialogues during the coming year, leading up an apotheosis (of sorts) on World Environmental Day in June 2023: <strong>“Conversations about Midcentury”</strong> and the world we want to live in.</p><p>These activities will help people structure their thinking – and feelings – and visualize possibilities for different sustainable futures. Using the <strong>Positive Cartography</strong> methodology – combining interactive media and visual thinking – participants will experience and explain their own preferred futures.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/05/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="592" height="354"></figure><p>The intention is to help people – young and old – become aware of the possibilities for and power of working together. Become aware of what they really want, and commit to work towards achieving it.</p><p><strong>Conversations about Midcentury</strong> is about people in different countries and continents thinking and working together.

It was a time to reflect on the value that was created during the last several weeks, and reflect on what we can do better, to create even more value over the next cycle.</p><p>Over the coming weeks we will be moving from laying foundations and orienting into doing the work of getting more concrete with the structural aspects of mapping, federating, and surfacing and meeting needs and solving problems as we prepare for a long-term engagement.</p><p>Along the way, we are planning to select a couple measurable projects to test our ‘muscles’ as an emerging community and see what we might be able to do together… Each 6 week cycle we intend to grow stronger and more capable as we work together to meet the needs and solve the problems inherent in this moment in history.</p><p>For whatever its worth, a few more of us now think that this approach may represent the best chance we have for 1) solving the total set of grand challenges 2) accomplishing the total set of global goals, and 3) forging the best and most flourishing possible future.</p><p>If you are interested in being a part of upcoming 6 week cycle, please reach out to <a href="mailto:j@lionsberg.org">Jordan</a>, <a href="mailto:kaminski@istori.com">Pete</a>, or <a href="mailto:everwiseone@gmail.com">Wendy McLean</a>, or find us on the <a href="https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/lionsberg-town-square">[Lionsberg] Town Square channel</a> on CSC Mattermost.</p><p>With Love, In Community, <br>~ The Meta Project</p><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-video-card kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-video-container"><video src="__GHOST_URL__/content/media/2022/05/birds-out-of-hand.mp4" poster="https://img.spacergif.org/v1/624x848/0a/spacer.png" width="624" height="848" loop autoplay muted playsinline preload="metadata" style="background: transparent url('__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/05/media-thumbnail-ember167.jpg') 50% 50% / cover no-repeat;" /></video><div class="kg-video-overlay"><button class="kg-video-large-play-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z"/></svg></button></div><div class="kg-video-player-container kg-video-hide"><div class="kg-video-player"><button class="kg-video-play-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z"/></svg></button><button class="kg-video-pause-icon kg-video-hide"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><rect x="3" y="1" width="7" height="22" rx="1.5" ry="1.5"/><rect x="14" y="1" width="7" height="22" rx="1.5" ry="1.5"/></svg></button><span class="kg-video-current-time">0:00</span><div class="kg-video-time">/<span class="kg-video-duration"></span></div><input type="range" class="kg-video-seek-slider" max="100" value="0"><button class="kg-video-playback-rate">1&#215;</button><button class="kg-video-unmute-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M15.189 2.021a9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h1.794a.249.249 0 0 1 .221.133 9.73 9.73 0 0 0 7.924 4.85h.06a1 1 0 0 0 1-1V3.02a1 1 0 0 0-1.06-.998Z"/></svg></button><button class="kg-video-mute-icon kg-video-hide"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M16.177 4.3a.248.248 0 0 0 .073-.176v-1.1a1 1 0 0 0-1.061-1 9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h.114a.251.251 0 0 0 .177-.073ZM23.707 1.706A1 1 0 0 0 22.293.292l-22 22a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.414l.009.009a1 1 0 0 0 1.405-.009l6.63-6.631A.251.251 0 0 1 8.515 17a.245.245 0 0 1 .177.075 10.081 10.081 0 0 0 6.5 2.92 1 1 0 0 0 1.061-1V9.266a.247.247 0 0 1 .073-.176Z"/></svg></button><input type="range" class="kg-video-volume-slider" max="100" value="100"></div></div></div><figcaption>“birds out of hand” – charles blass</figcaption></figure><hr><h2 id="the-power-of-three-emotional-intelligence-in-conversations">The Power of Three: Emotional Intelligence in Conversations</h2><p>by <strong>Ken Homer.</strong> An ongoing series about the <strong>Power of Three.</strong></p><p>In the last post we looked at a conversational response matrix from the conceptual perspective of the head brain. Now let’s switch to the heart brain and the coordinate system of emotions.</p><p>Many people will look at Professor Gable’s matrix and conclude that they operate out of the active constructive mode more often than not. However, we’re all subjects of unconscious habits and patterns in our communications. When we are unconscious about something, it means we are unaware of some aspect of our behavior even though it is clear for others to see. It’s hard to see our own behavior and we’re always doing things we’re unaware of – things other people notice but rarely tell us for a variety of reasons.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/05/EQ-in-Conversations.png" class="kg-image" alt="A 2 by 2 matrix that lists conversational strategies, Positive reinforcement, Passive Response, Negative Response, Non-Response." loading="lazy" width="1072" height="1160" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/EQ-in-Conversations.png 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2022/05/EQ-in-Conversations.png 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/05/EQ-in-Conversations.png 1072w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>We know the head brain has receptor sites for various neurotransmitters. It’s not much of a stretch to think that our heart brains would have similar emotional receptor sites for each of the four kinds of responses in this matrix. Whichever quadrant we speak from will light up that same quadrant in the listener. You can think of this as heart-brain mirror neurons.</p><p>Let’s look at an example. Suppose we’re talking with a friend and they tell us that they just received a job promotion. The diagram to the left illustrates four different ways we might respond to them verbally, each of which coordinates an emotional message between our heart brain and theirs.</p><p>What we say, along with how we say it, will provoke an emotional reaction.</p><p><strong>Self-observation:</strong> Begin to notice how you respond to the people closest to you when they share good news with you. How often are you operating from an active constructive stance? How often from the other stances? Is this surprising to you? What supports you in keeping up an active constructive approach? What makes active constructive challenging? What will you do with this new information?</p><p>The next post will look at the gut brain coordinate system and how our bodies communicate messages that may or may not be aligned with our words.</p><hr><h2 id="wildflowers">Wildflowers</h2><p>by <strong>Ken Homer</strong></p><p>Something different: here are a few pix of an amazing event that took place in 2009. An office park hydroseeded 5 acres of wildflowers. There were literally hundreds of thousands of flowers everywhere you looked. I spent hours walking among them. And I can attest that being around that many flowers had a profound and positive effect on my psyche. I wish they would do it again, but instead they landscaped the place with different plants. Too bad, it was quite a trip! I did make a screensaver from a bunch of these and one day I was doing a presentation on a 15’ screen. I forgot the screensaver was on I left a slide up for a long time when it kicked in and people were like: Whoa! Where is that?!</p><p>(View on the web so you can click on each image to enlarge.)</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/05/DSCN2580.jpg" width="1280" height="805" loading="lazy" alt srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/DSCN2580.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2022/05/DSCN2580.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/05/DSCN2580.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/05/DSCN2672.jpg" width="1199" height="960" loading="lazy" alt srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/DSCN2672.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2022/05/DSCN2672.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/05/DSCN2672.jpg 1199w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/05/DSCN2765.jpg" width="1280" height="960" loading="lazy" alt srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/DSCN2765.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2022/05/DSCN2765.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/05/DSCN2765.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/05/DSCN2858.jpg" width="1280" height="960" loading="lazy" alt srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/DSCN2858.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2022/05/DSCN2858.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/05/DSCN2858.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div></figure><hr><p><strong>Thank you for reading! </strong>Next edition will be published on 1 June 2022.
