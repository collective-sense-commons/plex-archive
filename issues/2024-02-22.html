It’s a complicated model, with some parts conceptually stronger but operationally questionable. To address this, I'm investing in smart young people to figure it out. I guide them by pointing where to go, give them initial research questions, partners to contact, etc.<br><br>The interns, of whom we may add more, will report to the young woman I hired to figure out the specifics. Personally, I prefer not to have anyone report directly to me. My role involves finding the funding and setting the problems to be solved.</p><p>In addition, I'm exploring opportunities on the new impact assets platform, where small groups can create a sub-account for investment purposes. My goal is to establish an investment club focused on giving to invest on this platform, especially targeting the biomedicinal market within our bioregion. This aligns with the interests of our $1 billion tourist industry.</p><p>I am hiring interns to conduct research in this area, emphasizing investments in Western North Carolina. The initial funding from me will be focused on areas where our <strong>WatershedFund</strong> is concentrated, following the principle of investing where we can make the most impact.</p><hr><h2 id="squintemerging-bioregion-self-awarenesssquint">&lt;squint&gt;Emerging Bioregion Self-Awareness&lt;/squint&gt;</h2><p>by <strong>David Witzel</strong></p><p>Bioregions are having a moment. Are we witnessing a&nbsp;<a href="https://the-wave.ongoodbits.com/social-phase-transitions" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>social phase transition</u></a>&nbsp;wherein bioregions go from coincidentally adjacent geophysical spaces to self-aware integrated living systems? Maybe if we squint?</p><p>Bioregions are geographic areas defined by the living systems rather than political boundaries. A bioregion is a natural organizing arena for regeneration efforts because it tends to contain multiple interrelated natural systems thus supporting something closer to a whole-system design opportunity.</p><p>The past dozen or so months have seen a series of bioregion identity-building events around North America including:</p><ul><li><strong>Casco Bay</strong>&nbsp;has had 2 learning journeys hosted by Glenn Page and&nbsp;<a href="https://cobaltlearningjourney.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>COBALT</u></a>.&nbsp; One in&nbsp;<a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/e48aa081ba4f4b948884aacb36ae585a" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>2022</u></a>&nbsp;and another in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.transformationscommunity.org/tc23-north-america-hub" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>2023</u></a>.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Regenerate Cascadia</strong>&nbsp;hosted the&nbsp;<a href="https://regeneratecascadia.org/2023-recordings/" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>2023 Cascadia Bioregional Summit</u></a>&nbsp;in November</li><li>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legacyproject.org/7gen/summit.html" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>7-Generation Bioregional Earth Summit</u></a>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;<strong>Greater Tkaronto Bioregion</strong>&nbsp;(northwest shore of Lake Ontario) recently finished.

A widespread bioregional awakening could enable an important new era for humanity and the globe as people become aware of the relationship between where we live and the living systems we are embedded in.</p><hr><h2 id="the-fault-in-the-framework">The Fault In The Framework</h2><p>by <strong>Patti Cobian</strong></p><p>For some time, lining the periphery of conversations about progress and innovation, something seemed apparent, but continued to remain just outside of the reach of language. It would grab my ankles and trip me when I picked up my pace, a familiar ghost; I’ve struggled to clear the tangle of its invisible web, or to free my suspicions of its nature back into the ether.</p><p>And then, a few days ago, a possibility fluttered down to me as I was driving, consenting to fit into a box of understanding that was just the right size, its edges defined enough for me to hold. As I beheld this fragile box of idea, I was able to understand:</p><p>The exotic birds of our vision and innovation, the most cherished of our shining ideas and speculations, all come from a world not of our making — so why on earth would they play by our rules?&nbsp;</p><p>We pin them down the moment they come close enough; we groom them, we train them, and we survey them with satisfaction; another treasure in our collection. If they survive our preening, we may try to stuff them into models and diagrams, championing them as the prize that&nbsp;<em>we&nbsp;</em>created, that&nbsp;<em>we&nbsp;</em>own, parading around these wild-caught moments of raw nature, each a precious moment of evolution itself.</p><p>But as I survey the vast landscape of idea and notion, the bleeding edges, I feel a sadness and I wonder:</p><p>What if ideas are Life itself emerging through us, living cogs of evolution, unfolding and driving itself forward? This fundamental design, this shared blueprint of all living things inherently skews along a singular vein of emergence, the pulse of Life undulating in its beauty and perfection and breathtaking complexity — if only we, the vessels, maintain a loose enough grip.</p><p>I have seen what happens to the humans who lock up an idea for too long, falling asleep night after night to the sound of wings beating against a metal cage.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve watched what happens to my own body when I swallow the brilliance of a thousand ideas that have tried to come through me, only to be shut away in the dark, unseen.</p><p>Others have died in the cages of my perfectionism, only to reincarnate onto the shoulder of another artist, months or years later.</p><p>I’ve seen fabulous, robust ideas whither and shrink when they are stuffed into old, rusty cages that were made too many years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>And time after time, I’ve watched the untamed spirit of an idea be broken as a human boldly claims “ownership” of it, “protecting” it with copyrights and penalties, its wild potential sequestered safely away in one single bank account.</p><p>Do we make the cages, do we claim the ownership, for the same reasons that we once claimed land and religion?&nbsp;</p><p>What if ideas, in their dynamic magnificence, were never meant to be pinned down as static creatures, a moment in time? I fear that our endless contortions, our wrestling of the beautiful and the natural, may not be in service to the idea as we may have believed, but in service to ourselves.</p><p>Are we merely building endless frameworks under which we might find shelter from the terror that we hold, pacifying our persistent fear of the unknown, of the immeasurable and the immutable, the inbreath and outbreath of our dread of dying? Or worse, that we never mattered at all?</p><p>Can we outrun our existential terror on the backs of clever, cutting wordplay, or else the most well-laid of plans? Can we buy ourselves more time to delay the inevitable: our sinking into the knowing that we control so little – or perhaps that we control nothing at all?</p><p>I stand alone in a silent room, empty but for the cages holding the lifeless and the dead, and I can’t help but fear that I’ve had it all wrong, for too long.</p><hr><h2 id="the-importance-of-a-gathering-place">The Importance of a Gathering Place</h2><p>by <strong>Ken Homer</strong></p><p>For years our friends Kiki and David <br>Had the perfect party house<br>An enclosed courtyard in the front<br>A spacious deck in the back overlooking a creek<br>And in-between a house with a large living room<br>Commodious kitchen – a dining room table that seats 12</p><p>Plus Kiki is a fabulous cook<br>At least two to three times a month<br>She’d put the word out to the 3 or 4 couples<br>Who made up our inner circle<br>Bocce at 4PM followed by potluck at our house<br>She’d make an amazing main dish <br>And we’d all bring sides<br>Wine flowed freely – weed was plentiful too</p><p>On special occasions – birthdays and holidays mainly<br>They’d host a party with up to 20 or 25 people<br>This went on for over a decade<br>It kept us all close and engaged in each other’s lives</p><p>Then came their announcement <br>We are subletting our house <br>We’re going to travel for a year<br>There was a big farewell party<br>There were tears too</p><p>Six months later they came back<br>This time with a different announcement:<br>We’ve decided to move to the Pacific Northwest <br>(To be closer to the grandkids)<br>This is a permanent move</p><p>All of us were happy for them and sad for us<br>No one else has a house that can accommodate us all<br>Well, in the summer we meet at the bocce court<br>Or out at <a href="http://parks.ca.gov/469" rel="noreferrer">Samuel P Taylor</a> or on someone’s deck<br>But “party central” had closed with deleterious effects<br>On the couples who had so regularly gathered over the years</p><p>We still see each other -

The Wade Memorial Nature Sanctuary is relatively small and infrequently visited since there are more majestic parks with towering sand dunes close by.</p><p>At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic I developed the habit of a sunrise hike with the dog, which I continue to this day. Wade was the most frequent destination for two and a half years because it was nearby and quiet, except for when the sandhill cranes were visiting.</p><p>I have likely walked that 1.1 mile loop more than 500 times. For a bit, I experimented with trail running there, too. But the trail is not groomed and protruding roots are not good for the ankles nor the gait.</p><p>I hiked because the outdoors, in addition to being my heart’s passion, was a refuge during that time. I could activate my senses, get the dog some exercise, and continue my lifelong pursuit of thinking less. Letting the body move and the mind rest.</p><p>If the Wade trail was a flavor of ice cream, she would be chocolate chip–dependable but with little frills or thrills. That’s what I thought when I began that oft-daily circle beneath the hemlocks and birches. The dog seemed to want to chase deer every day, and I was hoping to relive the moments of sighting owls, martens, tree frogs, and falcons. Wade rarely delivered a story worthy of telling at the breakfast table.</p><p>But as I became more familiar with the bends of the trail, the individual trees, the songs of the birds, and the shifting groundcover, I began to see more. There were more varieties of greens in the spring, and browns in the fall. The columbine appeared for just a short week. One day in the winter, an entire section of the forest was covered in snow fleas. I didn’t know such strange creatures existed.</p><p>The west side of the trail provides an overlook to Silver Lake, what I considered the highlight of the hike. But the modest grandiosity of the water became less so over time, and the delights delivered more in seeing how much changes every day.&nbsp;</p><p>I love exploring, whether it’s ideas or experiences or places. In these explorations, I’m often seeking what is new, or novel. Hiking the same trail hundreds of times showed me the surprises in the familiar, the new in the mundane. It was therapy, and it still is.</p><h3 id="photos-taken-at-wade-nature-sanctuary">Photos taken at Wade Nature Sanctuary</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/02/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200522063916962_COVER-COLLAGE.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1280" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200522063916962_COVER-COLLAGE.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200522063916962_COVER-COLLAGE.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/02/00100lrPORTRAIT_00100_BURST20200522063916962_COVER-COLLAGE.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/02/20180623_102722-COLLAGE.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1280" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/20180623_102722-COLLAGE.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/20180623_102722-COLLAGE.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/02/20180623_102722-COLLAGE.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/02/20181125_114008-COLLAGE.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1280" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/20181125_114008-COLLAGE.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/20181125_114008-COLLAGE.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/02/20181125_114008-COLLAGE.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/02/IMG_20200323_075136-COLLAGE.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1280" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/02/IMG_20200323_075136-COLLAGE.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/02/IMG_20200323_075136-COLLAGE.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/02/IMG_20200323_075136-COLLAGE.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><hr><p>Thank you for reading!
