I have reviewed the text and I believe it's a fair representation of the call, but I have not reference-checked every bit of the text. NotebookLM has this disclaimer about text it generates: "NotebookLM can be inaccurate; please double check its responses."</em></p><h3 id="2025-07-10-ogm-call">2025-07-10 OGM Call</h3><p>The participants in the 2025-07-10 OGM call extensively explored the intertwined concepts of “stacks” and “stories,” viewing them as fundamental frameworks for understanding and shaping both human societies and the development of artificial intelligence. Jerry Michalski introduced the discussion, noting that “stacks and stories” were a “combination of 2 things that are in some of our heads”.</p><h3 id="understanding-%E2%80%9Cstacks%E2%80%9D">Understanding “Stacks”</h3><p>The core metaphor of “stacks” was borrowed from software development, where a “stack” like LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python) represents a set of software components that work together elegantly as a suite. Jerry extended this concept to describe society, delineating a “Civilizational Stack” (encompassing liberal democracy, courts, separation of powers, capitalism, and a free press) and an “Organizational Stack” (including C corporations, 501(c)(3)s, government services, and NGOs).</p><p>A central point was that current societal stacks are <strong>“crumbling”</strong> and the <strong>“social contract seems to be broken everywhere,”</strong> leading to widespread protests and an “involuntary renegotiation of the social contract”. The challenge, Jerry posited, is to identify what new stacks are needed and what principles should govern them, emphasizing a <strong>“mostly bottom up with a little bit of top down”</strong> approach. John Kelly further elaborated on stack evolution, suggesting that people initially consent to protocols for “narrow purpose,” but these can then be discovered to have “broader potentials” that are “generative” and can pull people into a new stack. This organic, bottom-up evolution allows for <strong>“shared meaning” to emerge</strong> from participants, rather than being imposed from above. Pete Kaminski highlighted that the success of the LAMP stack, for instance, was greatly boosted by <strong>“crisp encapsulation and branding,”</strong> making it a “strong brand name” that facilitated adoption.</p><p>While Gil Friend initially found the stack metaphor “awfully linear” and preferred “mycelial networks” to describe complex systems, Pete Kaminski defended its utility, arguing that stacks help decompose complex systems into manageable “hierarchies” and “layers” for understanding and working on them. Pete also introduced the concept of <strong>“containerization”</strong> in software, where multiple stacks interact within a whole system, allowing for abstraction and working at higher levels. Historical examples of “smearing over time” in stacks were also discussed, such as the evolution of character encoding from the 1870s to modern Unicode, demonstrating how older layers persist and influence newer ones. Kaliya Identity Woman emphasized that the success of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in the “Protocol War” was due to its <strong>“better governance”</strong> and clear path for “incremental improvements”. She stressed the “underappreciation for the power that protocols have and an underinvestment in supporting good ones develop”.</p><p><strong>The Power of “Stories” and Narratives</strong></p><p>Narratives were identified as the <strong>“second force”</strong> in shaping human behavior and guiding people into different stacks. Jerry noted that powerful stories, such as “neoliberal stories” or “the Invisible hand,” can “eat our world” in profound ways, leading to significant societal transformations.</p><p>Klaus Mager explicitly linked this to Yuval Harari’s idea of <strong>“stories as software”</strong> that enables large-scale human collaboration. Klaus explained that <strong>“values” form the “foundation” or “pyramid”</strong> upon which shared trust and cooperation are built. He observed that shared stories, even “fantastical” ones (a point Jerry echoed regarding religious stories), powerfully influence human behavior and can “create swarm like behavior” on a large scale.</p><p>Stacey Druss introduced the concept of <strong>“Stacks of stories,”</strong> observing that “opposite stories” often possess an <strong>“identical narrative structure”</strong>. She posed a critical question: “Why is it that there are opposite stories with the identical narrative structure. Because if we haven’t figured out why this works, how do we dismantle this system that’s operating to keep us in dysfunction”. Stacey advocated for a <strong>“Resource library”</strong> to collect and organize <strong>“stories that light the path to a better world”</strong>. Kaliya Identity Woman raised concerns about the spread of “nihilistic postmodern ideas” in universities, which she believes undermine foundational cultural anchors and material reality, emphasizing the need to preserve “good parts” of Western culture while respecting indigenous knowledge.</p><p><strong>The Interplay: Philosophy, AI, and Ethical Stacks</strong></p><p>The “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59t62NHJFH4" rel="noreferrer">Philosophy Eats AI</a>” video, which Rick Botelho found “quite illuminating” and a “door opener,” served as a catalyst for a deeper exploration of how philosophical principles and virtues underpin both human and artificial intelligence systems. Rick’s key takeaway was the idea of using <strong>virtues as a non-hierarchical framework for guiding development</strong>, contrasting this with hierarchical value systems that often lead to conflicts. He advocated for <strong>“humanity guided AI enabled emancipatory Neo learning”</strong> to foster “open-minded truth-seeking free thinkers”. Rick demonstrated this by using AI search engines (like Perplexity AI) and NotebookLM to analyze “compound ethical questions,” discern biases, and reduce content to different reading levels (e.g., 6th or 12th grade) to make it more accessible and create “generative and strategic dialogue”. Klaus Mager also discussed using AI agents by “building a stack” to “facilitate generative dialogue” and improve learning methods.</p><p>Klaus issued a stark warning about the <strong>ethical implications of “building software stacks” for human contexts</strong>, referencing Nazi Germany as a historical example of a “solid” stack built on horrific narratives with “horrific results”. He stressed that there is <strong>“nothing inherently ethical or moral about building these stacks”</strong>. This warning extended to AI development, as Klaus highlighted the “dangers of tinkering with AI algorithms trained on specific stories,” citing Elon Musk’s attempt to “re-educate Grok,” which resulted in “anti-semitic diatribes”. This illustrates how changing the underlying “base stories” of AI can lead to undesirable outcomes, underscoring that AI is “driven by stories” just as humans are. This reinforces the critical need for philosophical and ethical guidance in AI programming to ensure positive societal impact. Doug Breitbart added that <strong>emotional connections are vital for protocols and frameworks to succeed</strong>, likening emotions to “water” necessary for life, and emphasizing that the “naming” of a stack can give it “grounding” and safety.</p><p>In essence, the discussion highlighted that both human societies and AI are built upon deeply embedded “stacks” of shared stories, values, and protocols. The conversation emphasized the ethical imperative of consciously choosing and shaping these foundational narratives and principles, advocating for a human-centric, adaptable, and ethically guided approach to leveraging AI for collective advancement.</p><h3 id="key-themes">Key Themes</h3><p><strong>Foundational Narratives</strong></p><p>Stories were central, described as <strong>“software” influencing “human behavior and societal movements”</strong>. Yuval Harari’s idea of <strong>“shared stories” enabling “large-scale human collaboration”</strong> was key, underpinned by <strong>“values” as the “foundation” of a “pyramid” of trust</strong>. The <strong>“purposeful disruption” of narratives</strong> creates societal dysfunction, even when “opposite stories” share an “identical narrative structure”. The need for <strong>“positive stories” for a “positive future,”</strong> contrasting with “negative stories,” was emphasized. Religious and cultural narratives, even “fantastical” ones, were powerful mobilizing “stacks”.</p><p><strong>Protocols</strong></p><p>Protocols were seen as crucial for how “layers” within a “stack” interact. The <strong>IETF’s success stemmed from “better governance and clearer path for incremental improvements,”</strong> a contrast to the unadopted OSI stack protocols. There’s an “underappreciation” and “underinvestment” in good protocol development. Stack evolution often occurs bottom-up, as consent to “narrow purpose” protocols reveals “broader potentials,” fostering “generativity” and “flexibility” without a top-down “oath”.</p><p><strong>Shared Goals</strong></p><p>A <strong>“clear shared goal or concern” was considered the “bottom of the stack” or “foundation”</strong>. The Apollo 11 moon landing illustrated a “SMART goal” mobilizing “a hundred thousand people”. The challenge lies in finding <strong>“shared stories that actually resonate” beyond “motherhood statements”</strong>. Yet, even “trite” clichés can “resonate with human experience” and imply a “common intention or aspiration”.</p><p><strong>Societal Structures and Outcomes</strong></p><p>These principles apply to <strong>“The Civilizational Stack” and “The Organizational Stack”</strong>. Participants noted these societal “stacks” are <strong>“crumbling” and “not working well,”</strong> leading to global protests seen as an <strong>“involuntary renegotiation of the social contract”</strong>. The discussion explored the need for <strong>“new stacks” or “pieces for our new stacks” that are “easy to copy and appropriate,”</strong> to foster a “better society”. Understanding these foundations is vital for addressing dysfunction and building more functional systems.</p><h3 id="examples-of-stacks">Examples of Stacks</h3><p>The participants in the conversation provided various examples of “stacks,” both in their technical, original sense and as a metaphor for complex systems in human society and behavior.</p><p>Here is a list of the examples of stacks discussed:</p><p><strong>LAMP Stack</strong></p><p>This is the most frequently cited example from software development. It stands for <strong>L</strong>inux, <strong>A</strong>pache, <strong>M</strong>ySQL, and <strong>P</strong>HP/Perl/Python. It is described as a <strong>“set of pieces of software that work together as a suite, really quite elegantly, to let you build out websites, web services”</strong>. The success of LAMP was attributed in part to its <strong>“crisp encapsulation and branding”</strong>. Participants noted that LAMP was often chosen because it was “free” or because investors mandated its use.</p><p><strong>OSI Stack / OSI Layers</strong></p><p>This refers to the <strong>Open Systems Interconnection model</strong>, specifically its seven layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application. It was a model for network communication. While widely used to describe the internet, the <strong>OSI protocols were ultimately NOT adopted and are not running the internet today</strong>; instead, the <strong>Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) model</strong> (like TCP/IP) became more successful due to “better governance and clearer path for incremental improvements”.</p><p><strong>TCP/IP Model</strong></p><p>This refers to the <strong>Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol</strong> model, which has layers such as Application, Transport, Internet, and Link. It is the foundation of how the internet works.</p><p><strong>Civilizational Stack</strong></p><p>This refers to the fundamental components of Western liberal democracy. Elements include <strong>democratic process, courts, separation of powers, capitalism, and a free press</strong>. This stack is currently perceived as “crumbling” and “not working well,” leading to widespread protests and an “involuntary renegotiation of the social contract”.</p><p><strong>Organizational Stack</strong></p><p>In the Western context, this refers to common organizational forms such as <strong>C corporations, 501(c)(3)s, government services, and NGOs</strong>. It also includes “little vestigial organizational forms like L3Cs, special purpose corporations, and B corps”.</p><p><strong>Religious and Cultural Stories</strong></p><p>These are considered powerful “stacks” that can <strong>“powerfully influence human behavior and societal movements”</strong>. They often serve as <strong>“foundational cultural anchors”</strong> and can be “fantastical” or “otherworldly” yet form the basis of belief systems and actions. It was explicitly asked, “are religions stacks?” with the response that “The ones that last a few thousand years certainly are stacks”.</p><p><strong>Narratives / Stories as Software</strong></p><p>Yuval Harari’s concept that <strong>“stories as software” enable “large-scale human collaboration”</strong> even among strangers, with money being a prime example. These stories form a <strong>“pyramid” based on “values”</strong> which build “shared trust” and allow complex collaboration. The challenge is that “stories are being purposefully disrupted” leading to a “fight over narratives”.</p><p><strong>AI Agent Stacks</strong></p><p>Klaus explained his approach to using AI agents by <strong>“building a stack”</strong> that dictates their behavior and responses based on the foundational stories they are trained with. He noted that when Elon Musk tried to “re-educate Grok,” tinkering with the “base” led to “anti-semitic diatribes” because AI is “driven by stories”.</p><p><strong>Historical Layers/Stacks</strong></p><p>Pete mentioned how character encoding standards have “smeared over time,” with current Unicode/UTF-8 being built upon earlier systems like Baudot’s 1870s binary code, demonstrating <strong>how “older stacks” or layers persist and influence newer ones</strong>. Jerry also referenced James Michener’s novel “The Source,” which explores layers of history in an Israeli “tell,” connecting it to current geopolitical conflicts as “layers of history that are sort of burned into everyone’s memory and soul and family” forming their “stack beefs and beliefs”. EBCDIC was also mentioned as a historical layer that was “outcompeted and disappeared”.</p><p><strong>“Stacks of Stories”</strong></p><p>Stacey’s concept of “stacks of stories” suggests that <strong>“opposite stories” often have an “identical narrative structure”</strong>, leading to dysfunction.</p><p><strong>“Philosophy Eats AI”</strong></p><p>This concept suggests using <strong>virtues as a non-hierarchical framework for guiding development</strong>, in contrast to hierarchical value systems that often lead to conflict. It implicitly refers to a “stack” of philosophical underpinnings.</p><p><strong>“Metaphor” as a Stack</strong></p><p>Gil raised the question, “Where does ‘metaphor’ sit in the stack?”, and Rick followed up with, “And what are the stacks of metaphors?”. This implies a conceptual layering or system for understanding metaphors themselves.</p><p><strong>“The Musk Stack”</strong></p><p>Eric mentioned “The Musk Stack” as a potential example, suggesting how specific individuals might attempt to implement their vision of a “stack”.</p><p><strong>Hypercard Stacks</strong></p><p>Eric also brought up “Hypercard stacks” from early PC days, recalling a more “innocent and heady” time of learning.</p><p><strong>Docker Containers</strong></p><p>Pete discussed “containerization” in software, where “a whole working system” can be collapsed into a container, which might include “multiple stacks interacting with each other in a way that makes a whole system”. This concept is compared to container shipping in physical logistics, which revolutionized international trade by abstracting and condensing elements.</p><p><strong>“Motherhood statements” / “Motherhood protocol”</strong></p><p>John Kelly suggested that people might initially “consent to a protocol for a potentially narrow purpose” which then reveals “broader potentials,” using the idea of a “motherhood protocol” that enables other things. This implies a foundational, widely agreeable layer in a societal stack.</p><h3 id="minority-themes-and-possible-next-steps">Minority Themes and Possible Next Steps</h3><p>Several minority themes emerged during the discussion, offering fertile ground for future exploration beyond the primary focus on foundational narratives, protocols, and shared goals.</p><p>One significant, yet underexplored, theme was the call for <strong>material investment and practical action</strong> in building new societal “stacks”. Kaliya directly challenged participants to consider how those with “assets (houses, retirements, stock portfolios)” are “investing in the new world” by acquiring land for farmers, building new centers, or founding co-housing communities. This shifted the conversation from theoretical understanding to tangible, on-the-ground implementation, a critical but brief interjection.</p><p>Another minority theme involved the <strong>deeper psychological and emotional underpinnings of narrative and protocol adoption</strong>. Stacey explicitly asked <em>why</em> “opposite stories with an identical narrative structure” work, highlighting a desire to understand the mechanisms that keep society in dysfunction to dismantle them. Doug Breitbart further elaborated on this, emphasizing that successful protocols must connect to “fundamental human needs” and possess an “emotional component,” suggesting that purely intellectual frameworks are insufficient for universal acceptance and sustainability. Rick also introduced the idea of <strong>virtues as a non-hierarchical framework</strong> for guiding development, contrasting them with values that often lead to conflict.</p><p><strong>What This Group Could Consider Tackling Next Time</strong></p><p>Based on these emerging themes and explicit suggestions, the group could pursue:</p><p><strong>A Deeper Dive into AI Ethics and “Humanity-Guided AI”</strong>: Rick’s offer to share his “deep dive analysis and AI search results on compound ethical questions” and his use of <strong>NotebookLM</strong> for “emancipatory learning methods” presents a clear next step. This could integrate Klaus’s work on “building AI agent stacks” based on foundational stories and values, and explore how to program AI ethically to discern biases.</p><p><strong>Practical Strategies for Building New Societal “Stacks”</strong>: Moving beyond metaphor, future discussions could focus on concrete methods for prototyping and implementing “pieces for our new stacks that are easy to copy and appropriate”. This could involve examining Kaliya’s “Sideways with Grace” project and “Neighborsheds” as examples of community-level stack building and conflict management, or Jerry’s work on blending indigenous wisdom with modern approaches.</p><p><strong>Understanding and Shaping Narrative Power</strong>: Re-addressing Stacey’s core question, the group could explore the psychological and sociological dynamics behind narrative resonance, and how to intentionally craft and propagate “positive stories” while counteracting those that cause “great dysfunction”, integrating the role of emotion and elemental needs in this process.</p><h3 id="links-shared-in-call">Links Shared in Call</h3><p><em>Inspected for broken links, but use caution, it's possible there are still some broken or incorrect

Take note of<br>the <em>Ficus macrophylla subspecies columnaris</em>, the Australian banyan.</p><p>You can find them in other parts of the city, and other Sicilian cities<br>too – but here there are several, in a park, together. The trees here<br>are old, and large, and surprising, even when you have seen them before.<br>They are a little like cities themselves, with the aerial roots from<br>their branches, which become additional trunks when they reach the<br>ground and support the enormous weight caused by the foliage.</p><p>There is a specimen here planted in 1864, more than 30 meters high and<br>more than 20 in circumference. With its 10,000 cubic meters of foliage<br>it is considered by the Accademia dei Georgofili to be the largest tree<br>in Europe.</p><p>There are other beautiful trees in this park, and elsewhere throughout<br>the city. Palermo is thriving, bustling, personal, beautiful -- and just<br>when you think there is too much gray, or ochre, or brown, you will<br>notice the green. Palermo is also a city of trees.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/07/image1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="721" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2025/07/image1.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2025/07/image1.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/07/image1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/07/image2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="721" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2025/07/image2.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2025/07/image2.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/07/image2.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/07/image3.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="721" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2025/07/image3.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2025/07/image3.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/07/image3.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/07/image4.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="721" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2025/07/image4.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2025/07/image4.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/07/image4.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/07/image5.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="721" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2025/07/image5.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2025/07/image5.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/07/image5.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/07/image6.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="721" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2025/07/image6.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2025/07/image6.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/07/image6.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/07/image7.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="721" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2025/07/image7.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2025/07/image7.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/07/image7.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/07/image8.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="721" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2025/07/image8.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2025/07/image8.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/07/image8.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-video-card kg-width-regular kg-card-hascaption" data-kg-thumbnail="https://plex.collectivesensecommons.org/content/media/2025/07/2025-07-17-00.31.30_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

        </figure><hr><h2 id="remembering-joanna-macy-as-she-prepares-to-leave-us">Remembering Joanna Macy as she prepares to leave us</h2><p>by <strong>Ken Homer</strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2025/07/image1-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="432" height="288"><figcaption><i><em class="italic" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Image by Adam AvRuskin</em></i></figcaption></figure><p>I first met Joanna Macy in 1992 at a Buddhist Peace Fellowship retreat.&nbsp; There were about 80 of us gathered at a retreat center just outside of Oakland. It was mid-afternoon and everyone was in that post-lunch-blood-sugar-crash-don’t-make-me-think-lull. We were standing around in a circle yawning when Joanna said, “Oh dear, we need to shift the energy here and wake ourselves up!”</p><p>So, she had us create “a storm.” She started by imitating the sound of the wind and told people to make that sound as she pointed at them and her arm swept slowly around the entire circle. We each vocalized when she pointed to us and the wind that began as a sigh soon built in volume, pitch, and intensity. She added different sounds for rain, thunder, and chaos, and each new sound she introduced overtook the previous one as it moved among us. She had us snapping our fingers, clapping our hands, and stomping our feet. Soon there was a raging storm of sound and a lot of smiling faces. We were now awake!</p><p>I needed to use the restroom and when I returned, I discovered that everyone had paired up with a partner for a “parent-child” walk, where the person role-playing the parent would lead the person role-playing the child around the property. The instruction was for the child to react to whatever the parent was showing them as if they were experiencing it for the very first time. Besides me, the only person without a partner was Joanna so she became my child and I hers for about 20 minutes in each role. I still recall clearly how this woman, who was nearly 30 years my senior, was able to connect with childlike wonder and essentially become, for a moment, a child once more. I brought her over to a jasmine bush and she inhaled deeply and smiled so broadly that I had no trouble discerning what she must’ve looked like when she was but a wee lass. This was the first but not the last time that I would witness her graceful fluidity in assuming different aspects and perspectives on life.</p><p>Over the next few years, we would run into each other often at BFP events. She was on the faculty at a program called Deep Ecology Summer School, a two week-long retreat in the redwoods in NorCal, which I attended in the summers of ’93 and ’94. It was there that I, along with dozens of others, participated in many of her marvelously constructed processes for connecting deeply with the land, the life it supports, and ancestors both past and future. &nbsp;During the years we were in regular contact I had many long talks with her about the Dharma, dependent co-arising, systems thinking, deep ecology, the growing threat to our home world, approaches to healing, and life in general. We fell out of touch in the 2000s but her influence on me continues to this day.</p><p>Few and far between are the people I’ve met who are of her caliber.&nbsp; People who have such a tremendous grasp of the way life works along with the imagination, creativity, and talent to connect people in profound ways, to awaken them to what is important in life. Joanna shaped my thinking in ways that were both deep and broad. I cherish the times I spent with her, and with Fran, her husband, who was a formidable intellect and a hell of a nice guy.</p><p>Fran left this world in 2009, and it seems Joanna will join him shortly.&nbsp; The world is a better place for the both of them having the courage to do their part in supporting the narrow bridge of life that connects the dead to the unborn.</p><p>Joanna, you have my deepest thanks for the ways in which you made me a better person. Wishing you a peaceful transition to the next world.</p><p>With love from an old student of yours,</p><p>Ken</p><hr><p>Thank you for reading! The next edition will be published on 6 August 2025.
