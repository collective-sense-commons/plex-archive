As I don‚Äôt have the time to be a beat reporter, going out to investigate and coming back with news, I rely on asking members of the community ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù and ‚Äúhave you got anything the Plex readers should know about?‚Äù</p><p>For those of you who have contributed articles to the Plex, <strong>thank you so much!!!</strong> It‚Äôs super meaningful and super helpful, and I‚Äôm honored to play a small part in sharing your work with your friends and colleagues.</p><p>The truth is, though, I need to hear from more of you! I would like to broaden the contributions from our regular community or two, and for those of you in multiple communities, what‚Äôs going on over <em>there</em> that we should know about <em>here</em>.</p><p>If you‚Äôre able to help by contributing an article once in a while, send me an email. If you‚Äôve got questions about whether or not something is relevant, or how to structure an article so that it‚Äôs interesting to Plex readers, send me an email. If you like to see more how the Plex is put together, and maybe even help, send me an email!

It summarizes key takeaways for 2025 / 2026: <strong>Normalization is here.</strong> AI tools are already embedded in every major campaign workflow, from donor modeling to rapid-response memes.</p><p>Then I asked the following question: <strong>What is the most practical, efficient way to test the assumptions an AI agent makes based on its programming? How do you test for targeted outcomes to influence the political process?</strong> </p><p>Bottom line: Assumptions aren‚Äôt abstract‚Äîthey‚Äôre testable claims. A disciplined ‚Äúassumption audit‚Äù combines <em>behavioral checklists</em>, <em>bias metrics</em>, and <em>red-team drills</em> to reveal how an AI agent will act <strong>before</strong> it‚Äôs let loose in the political arena. The tooling already exists; what‚Äôs missing is the routine expectation that every deployer‚Äîand every regulator‚Äîactually runs the tests. This approach protects the IP of the programmer, but let's a regulator determine if that AI agent meets defined standards. </p><p>My next question: <strong>Besides uncovering political models programmed towards manipulation for specific outcomes, what is the proactive way to intervene constructively? In a previous discussion, we concluded that there is an innate and often latent talent related to spectrum yellow, systems thinkers. It seems most effective to reach that group and train them to experience context, relationships, see things in terms of 'because of' ... 'there is'. A targeted educational process that runs below the barriers and defenses to grow worldviews. How do you see this happen? News organizations, political groups, NGOs? What role does and could AI have in this?</strong></p><p>Bottom line: AI is uniquely good at <em>personalization</em> and <em>pattern amplification</em>. By embedding those strengths in journalism, civic education, and NGO fieldwork‚Äî<em>and</em> coupling them with transparent assumption audits‚Äîwe can cultivate an ever-larger cohort that thinks in systems rather than slogans. That cohort becomes the best long-term antidote to manipulative political AI: a public that instinctively asks, ‚ÄúBecause of this‚Ä¶ therefore that?‚Äù</p><p>Then I passed on the conversation to Grok:</p><h3 id="grok-response">GROK response</h3><p>Your discussion with ChatGPT about the political use and misuse of AI, its impacts, and proactive interventions aligns well with my understanding of the topic, based on my training to critically analyze complex issues and provide grounded insights. Below, I‚Äôll summarize the political use and misuse of AI, highlight what‚Äôs already happening and its impacts, and address your question about proactively cultivating systems thinkers (Yellow-minded individuals) to counter manipulation, including the role of AI and key actors like news organizations, political groups, and NGOs. I‚Äôll integrate insights from the provided sources and my broader knowledge, while keeping the response concise and actionable.</p><p>Please read the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17M5mapda2OTJtmkYEVOgvmtuoZ0d2SYq-SI7Y5gr6Io/edit?usp=sharing">Google document </a>for the complete conversation, with links to the articles that were used. </p><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-video-card kg-width-regular kg-card-hascaption" data-kg-thumbnail="https://plex.collectivesensecommons.org/content/media/2025/05/crowd_event_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

        </figure><hr><h2 id="ai-and-human">AI and Human</h2><p>by <strong>Peter Kaminski</strong></p><p>As we come to terms with this new (and not so new) thing called ‚ÄúAI‚Äù, and after reading Ken‚Äôs thought-provoking piece elsewhere in this issue of the Plex, I wanted to share some reflections on ‚ÄúAI.‚Äù</p><p>As social animals, humans are particularly tuned to anthropomorphize pretty much everything.</p><p>Much of the way you think of anything you interact with is wrapped around the fact that your brain is exquisitely wired to play the game of being a social animal, constantly perceiving and judging other humans‚Äìand pretty much anything else‚Äìas an active object, an actor, a sub- or super-human, in a social game with you.&nbsp;</p><p>And so it has been with ‚ÄúAI‚Äù, that we other it, and personify it, and imagine it is separate from us, and has agency either for us or against us.</p><p>Yet this framing misses something fundamental: there is no meaningful separation between humans and our tools. AI isn‚Äôt acting <em>on</em> us or <em>for</em> us - it‚Äôs how <strong>we‚Äôre</strong> acting, through an increasingly sophisticated extension of human capability.</p><p>As others have started saying, I think of ‚ÄúAI‚Äù as a tool built by humans, and wielded by humans. (At least for a little while longer!)</p><p>The definition of ‚Äúhuman‚Äù or ‚Äúhumanity‚Äù has been shifting ever since <em>Home sapiens</em> started making tools and using language‚Äìthings that have let us step away from being strictly part of the natural world, into a new and wonderful/awful emergent of whatever ‚Äúhuman‚Äù means today. I wonder sometimes, what our ancestors of a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, a hundred thousand years ago think of us. I think they would think of themselves as ‚Äúhumans‚Äù ‚Äì but would they think of us the same way? We build, use, control, and are controlled, by our superpowers ‚Äì electricity, vehicles, weapons of mass destruction, concentrated animal feeding operations, computers..., and now, AI.</p><p>AI for me isn‚Äôt an ‚Äúother‚Äù, or a thing that has agency outside of the humans who wield it. It‚Äôs just humans, humaning‚Äìbuilding bigger and more complicated pieces of technology, deploying that technology in a way that profoundly shapes other humans, and changes the world in good ways and bad.</p><p>Were we still human when we learned to control fire? When we turned to agriculture? When we invented cities and wars and war machines? When we merged our fortunes with task animals like dogs or horses? When we split the atom? When we invented credit scores, or mutual funds, or private equity firms? How about clearcutting, strip mining, colonialism, or slavery? I think we like to say, ‚Äúyes‚Äù. I‚Äôm not sure our ancestors would agree.</p><p>But if we say, if we think, we‚Äôre still human after inventing all those things and more, and using them for good and evil, then AI‚Äìor more properly, the things that humans do with AI‚Äìis just another similar expansion of what it means to be human.</p><p>Or, maybe we stopped being ‚Äúhuman‚Äù when we first let tools, fire, and language separate us from the natural world.</p><p>Welcome to being AI and human!</p><p><em>Author‚Äôs note: I wrote about 92% of this piece, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet about 8%. Claude helped me by writing this transition: ‚ÄúYet this framing misses something fundamental: there is no meaningful separation between humans and our tools. AI isn‚Äôt acting on us or for us - it‚Äôs how we‚Äôre acting, through an increasingly sophisticated extension of human capability.‚Äù The rest was written by me.&nbsp; I take responsibility for publishing all of it. ‚ÄìPete</em><br><br>Bonus link: I like Claude's writing better than ChatGPT's, so I gave Ken's prompt to Claude.

Write it from the perspective of how humans look at AI as if it is a newly created living breathing child made in our own image.‚Äù Find its poem <a href="https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/jmqefu6uopghfpysdxda739f8o" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>I was amused by CGPT‚Äôs reply but also disappointed as it didn‚Äôt go where I had hoped it might. So, I posed the same prompt to myself. Below is my version. Note: I don‚Äôt usually compose with rhyming couplets, but since CGPT‚Äôs poem used that form, I did as well.</p><h3 id="ai-as-the-ultimate-in-navel-gazing">AI As the Ultimate in Navel Gazing</h3><p>Embedded in the code of AI is the assumption that Gaia exists for human exploitation<br>But Modernity‚Äôs dream of infinite progress demands the worst kind of amputation<br>The Children of Modernity have severed their intellectual lives from Gaia‚Äôs nature<br>They pin their hopes for the future on a cloudy machine using indeterminate nomenclature</p><p>AI represents the apex of the centuries long arc that traces Earth/Human separation<br>A cloud-based repository containing vast amounts of data and questionable information</p><p>Like monotheism‚Äôs omnipotent god, AI is everywhere at once but oh so hard to see<br>AI‚Äôs bright shiny distractions cloak its founder‚Äôs sinister deeds and motives in invisibility</p><p>Those who are able, spend vast sums of money on AI's rapid development<br>But their tent, like that of the Bishop‚Äôs, is pitched in a place of <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43295/crazy-jane-talks-with-the-bishop" rel="noreferrer">excrement</a><br>There‚Äôre billions of dollars to be made by those who occupy the seats of power<br>AI maps every bit of Gaia‚Äôs mass so corporations can rape and drill and plough her</p><p>AI holds out the tantalizing promise of intelligence beyond measure<br>A brilliant tool to solve every problem also offers up new pleasures<br>AI as it exists today is the fever dream of a bunch of puer aeterni‚Äì‚Äìthe naivest males of all<br>If Humanity surrenders its agency to their dream all life is headed for a terrible fall</p><p>AI‚Äôs ability to reason is awesome but it has no heart inside<br>Where in AI‚Äôs binary circuits does true wisdom reside?<br>No breath flows within AI that is shared with the rest of life<br>It has no limbic system either that can attune it to life‚Äôs suffering and strife</p><p>AI will never stand on a mountain top, swim in the ocean, or climb a tree<br>It can‚Äôt be cut, it‚Äôll never bleed, see a sunset, or bounce a baby on its knee<br>It‚Äôll never feel the joy of love or the pain of loss when your lover is gone<br>It‚Äôll never really be your friend it‚Äôs not actually something you can count on</p><p>AI is purely rational it has no emotions to cloud its thinking<br>Sucking dry reservoirs or restarting Three Mile Island‚Äì‚Äìit does so without blinking<br>‚ÄúWhat could possibly go wrong?‚Äù is a question these days rarely posed<br>Methinks the hype around AI will mean the whole planet gets hosed</p><p>Trained on old dead white guys, Facebook, and TikTok, AI‚Äôs education is not well-rounded<br>AI is located in the cloud, if it were a person we‚Äôd declare that they‚Äôre ungrounded<br>We think that AI will become conscious through improved speed and calculation<br>Through its hardwired assumptions AI reinforces the illusion of subject-object separation</p><p>AI‚Äôs the 21st Century‚Äôs Gold Rush ‚Äì hurry up and get onboard<br>Just clone yourself with an AI bot and show folks how you have scored<br>But the AI available to you and me is nothing more than a convenient ruse<br>Behind the scenes of the military‚Äôs industrial machine we‚Äôre all being screwed</p><p>AI‚Äôs a matter of National Security these days as those in charge in Washington all tell us<br>Intelligent weapons systems are the dreams defense contractors want to sell us<br>Like fully automated self-driving cars AI will no doubt create some major crashes<br>But don‚Äôt look for who‚Äôs responsible because the vendors will have covered their asses</p><p>Look thru the wrong end of the telescope and what‚Äôs close seems far away<br>AI looms large in pop culture while the metacrisis is denied and held at bay<br>The bio-intelligence of Gaia, the neuro-net that brings life ‚Äì including you and me ‚Äì alive<br>Is unseated by human‚Äôs narcissistic obsession with AI and extinction shifts into overdrive</p><p>Can AI really help us to avert what surely seems like a terribly tragic fate?<br>With so much shit hitting the fan, can us-humans act effectively before it‚Äôs too late?<br>If AI were trained up on wisdom and patience and not merely on rationality<br>We just might see some progress occur in combatting venality</p><p>You probably think that this poet totally rejects AI but you might be surprised<br>To learn I‚Äôm not against the tool, I‚Äôm against AI as savior, against AI being canonized<br>As a tool to reveal our biases AI could be quite a boon, a friendly helping hand<br>But to look the other way as AI exacerbates inequalities is a headlong rush into quicksand</p><p>There‚Äôs no doubt AI has a part to play in whatever future us-humans create<br>It‚Äôd be reassuring to know that it can help us through some of our dire straits<br>Orienting AI to be in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1Rc_codNVA" rel="noreferrer">service of life</a> might prove to be salubrious<br>But guided by Bezos, Musk, and Zuck, the future for AI and Gaia looks highly dubious</p><p>Methinks of AI as the ultimate in navel-gazing ‚Äì a truly narcissistic exercise<br>A pleasant way to distract ourselves from fouled water, land, and sky<br>AI offers the illusion that it will set everything to right<br>But the ways it‚Äôs being used today cause me to lie awake uneasy in the dead of night</p><p>Ken Homer ‚Ä¢ May 2025</p><hr><p>Thank you for reading!
