## Systemic Creativity
by **Klaus Mager**

We did discuss some time ago what it means to be creative, and I explained the [Imagineering perspective](https://sites.disney.com/waltdisneyimagineering/our-process/). There is a desired outcome, a picture what the result should look like. Then it is all about digging into the details, the connections, the inferences, letting the system see itself, emergence. Once it is transparent, all sorts of things come to light, effortlessly.

We are operating an industrial age economy side by side with a space age toolbox. The sheer scale of humanity's impact on the planetary systems has changed the ground rules, the reality we live in. On the one side is the inertia of status quo that hinders any and all disruptions to prevailing power structures, on the other side is an increasingly dangerous unfolding of changes in the ecosphere caused by the way we interact with her. 

At this point still **the design imperative is dictated by status quo, when it has to be the ecosphere.** Still trying to force reality to meet visions that under the best of circumstances are unable to materialize in time to make the necessary difference.

There are pent-up innovations ready to scale, the system is in desperate need of regenerative change, and change has to start at the systems level, high up in the chain. The only apparent role that government can play is to be the referee, fair play in the markets, insisting on science and evidence based assumptions driving the economy.

What we learned in this discussion today is the need to engage an informed public, when we are living in a media world that by design causes confusion and distraction. The challenge speaking in [Spiral Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_Dynamics) language is to engage the spiral at every stage, with context specific messaging. That is a very practical thing to do, connecting the rainbow. It requires skills, intention, application. All of it is based on trust, working with like minded groups and individuals towards shared intentions.

How to cut through the clutter and the noise? I submit our very lives depend on it.
