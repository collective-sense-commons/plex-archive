## “Vision For Good Living” Website Launched
by **Killu Sanborn**

Check out the newly launched **Vision For Good Living** website at [holisticvisions.life](https://holisticvisions.life/), an example of a collectively co-created vision for a society in alignment with primordial wisdom principles and Nature.

For 12 months, 144 of us from 30+ countries held weekly Zoom sessions, also convening for a symposium in Barcelona. Under the leadership of **Le Ciel Foundation,** we trained to become coherent as groups, sought to engage as our best selves, and learned to coordinate between all the themes and groups, working as a global distributed community.

We are eager to connect with other groups and initiatives building a better world of good living for everyone everywhere! For more on how Vision For Good Living was born at, watch this video: [Holistic Visions 2021 - A 12 lunar cycle journey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9P20cXSbFU) (YouTube).
