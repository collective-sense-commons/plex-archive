Transcript:

Ever since the [Brundtland Report](https://www.are.admin.ch/are/en/home/media/publications/sustainable-development/brundtland-report.html) in 1987, the word “sustainability” has come to dominate much of our public discourse when we talk about our collective future.

However, sustainability does not evoke the kind of compelling vision for humanity's future that we need if we are to rise to the challenges of our time.

We choose to refer to creating a “flourishing future” where we heal our relationships to each other and to the Earth.
