## Complexity Adventures Tech Team
by **Shaun Swanson **and **Peter Kaminski**

**Shaun** (CA) and **Pete** (CSC) met during this week’s weekly **CA Tech Team** meeting to discuss options for Complexity Adventure to have a **Mattermost** chat space.

Due to the CA need to have a CA-specific namespace for single-sign-on usernames, it looks like they’ll probably need their own Mattermost instance, but they’d love to have interconnection of some kind between the CA and CSC Mattermosts–maybe a channel bridge? Maybe figure out how to federate with ActivityPub? Who knows, the sky’s the limit!

Raw meeting notes for the CA 5/16/2023 Tech Team meeting are in the CA Coda: [https://coda.io/d/CA-tech_dnY8CSQcH9Y/Meeting-Minutes_suVcf#_lue1x](https://coda.io/d/CA-tech_dnY8CSQcH9Y/Meeting-Minutes_suVcf#_lue1x)
