## Voice of Humanity Joins CSC Mattermost
by **Grace Rachmany** for BPD

I'll be bringing the graduates of my workshop **“The Future Ain't What It Used to Be”** on to CSC Mattermost . I've added a couple of channels that are specific to my group “[voh]” plus a few open topics, **Alternative Economic Systems**, **DAOs and Democracy**, **Money and Alternative Currency**, **NFTs and Crypto Gaming**. My group is approximately 100 people, and we'll see how many decide to join the Mattermost.

I’ll be opening the workshop rebranded as the **“Future Series”** as soon as I figure out the tech infrastructure for how to deliver the curriculum. Open Global Mind and other communities can participate in that freely. This will be instead of/inclusive of the “money conversations” that I said I’d be doing in the OGM group. I’ll make an announcement as soon as that is working.
