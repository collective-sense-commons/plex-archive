## Plex Conversations
by **Peter Kaminski**

I am starting a practice of having one-on-one conversations with members of the Plex intercommunities, with the goal of helping us all know each other better, and to think better together. In this stage of the process, I am sharing some of the best nuggets of conversation, not necessarily a whole dialogue or story. Weâ€™ll bootstrap from there.

I invite you to also have a conversation with another person, inside or outside of the Plex, and to share the best parts of that conversation with all of us. Send me an email at [kaminski@istori.com](mailto:kaminski@istori.com).

Following are some nuggets from two recent conversations, one with Todd Hoskins, and one with Gil Friend.
