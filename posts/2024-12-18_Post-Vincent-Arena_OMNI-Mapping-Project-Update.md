## OMNI-Mapping Project Update
by **Vincent Arena** and **Wendy McLean**

[Vincent Arena](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincentarena/) and [Wendy McLean](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wendy-mclean/) announce an update to the [OMNI-Mapping Project](http://www.omnimapping.org/). The OMNI-Mapping Project has just released a free and powerful [Miro board template ](https://miro.com/miroverse/omni-mapping-assessment/)to conduct an ‚ÄúEcosystem Mapping Assessment‚Äù. This assessment is designed to holistically understand the ecosystem (in the sense of a bounded system) you plan to map, in order to design tech and social infrastructure needed to create the desired outputs to reach your goals. This ecosystem could be a bioregion, a neighborhood, a group of organizations, a knowledge commons project, or an endless range of other use cases.  The full template is available here: [https://miro.com/miroverse/omni-mapping-assessment/](https://miro.com/miroverse/omni-mapping-assessment/)

Inspired by Buckminster Fuller‚Äôs vision of systemic design science, The OMNI-Mapping Project enables bioregional teams, organizations, and a wide range of other users to create clearer, more actionable maps. OMNI-Mapping extends the powerful [Catalist.Network](https://www.catalist.network/site?space=catalist-intro) platform, a social impact network and digital library where you can discover projects, events, and opportunities to change the world. 

OMNI-Mapping process enables multiple types of maps to be developed and shared interoperably:

üï∏Ô∏è Network Maps: These are broad in scope covering various types of networks, including organizational, social, and informational.

üèµÔ∏è GIS Maps: Geographical Information Systems (GIS) maps are used to visualize geographical data.

ü¶â Systems Dynamics Maps: These maps detail problems, their relationships, feedback loops, as well as solutions and their impacts.

üê¶‚Äçüî• Concept Maps: These help in understanding and organizing knowledge by showing relationships between concepts through connected nodes.

üê≥ Asset Maps: Non-geographical asset mapping is the process of cataloging and organizing resources into a directory or visual representation based on their type, topic, or function, rather than their physical location.

OMNI-Mapping Project is fiscally sponsored by the Buckminster Fuller Institute. If you have any questions or would like to contribute to this project in any way, please contact either of the project‚Äôs co-leads: [vincent@omnimapping.org](mailto:vincent@omnimapping.org) (master architect) or [wendy@omnimapping.org](mailto:wendy@omnimapping.org) (mapper and ecosystem weaver).
