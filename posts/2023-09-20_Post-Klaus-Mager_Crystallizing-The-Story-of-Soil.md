## Crystallizing “The Story of Soil”
by **Klaus Mager**

Dear Plex readers,

I think we can test run phase 1 of the NeoBook “[The Story of Soil](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t8jppx3sqvjxs9mRHJA-FQbsyZUVmJu0/edit?usp=sharing)”.

It has reached a point of what in Theory U language would be called ‘[Crystallizing](https://www.leadershipnow.com/leadingblog/2018/04/the_essentials_of_theory_u.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CCrossing%20the%20threshold%20means%20to%20be%20willing%20to,emerge%20from%20a%20deep%20connection%20to%20the%20source.)’. We know what to do, but can’t imagine how it would be possible.

At this stage we are ready to start [prototyping](https://medium.com/presencing-institute-blog/theory-u-prototyping-integrating-past-present-and-emerging-future-370bd1383aef). This NeoBook envisions this to be the moment of now, seeking the path forward.

I’m off the grid for 2 weeks to reflect and recover, would love to get feedback on the Google Doc, or in the [NeoBook channel on CSC Mattermost](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/ogm-sensedoing).

Thank you,
Klaus
