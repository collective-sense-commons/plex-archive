The format is virtual, one day, co-created by attendees using [open space technology](https://www.thoughtfulbiometrics.org/format.html).

Our goal is to support “uncommon conversations” to deepen understanding between various stakeholders all engaged in work related to biometrics, AI and digital identity to consider the social and policy implications.We welcome participants from **civil society advocacy groups,** **scientists and academics** that research and innovate biometric technologies, companies that make **biometric products,** **organizations that implement biometric technologies** - like the US and Canadian government - as well as **NGOs** and **interested citizens.**We invite discussion about tangible risks and threat models at all levels, from micro to macro systems. We hope you will join us.Register here: [Thoughtful Biometrics Workshop 2023](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/thoughtful-biometrics-workshop-2023-tickets-297266601407).
