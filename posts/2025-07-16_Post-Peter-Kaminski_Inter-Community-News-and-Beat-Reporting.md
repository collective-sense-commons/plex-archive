## Inter-Community News and Beat Reporting
by **Peter Kaminski**

I’m organizing a couple of informal calls during the weeks of **July 21** and **July 28** for anyone interested in exploring a **distributed version of Plex**, with shared and cross‑syndicated stories across communities. These calls are meant to be an opportunity to:

- Rally **beat reporters** and other folks passionate about **intra‑ and inter‑community news**
- Co‑design how we can circulate stories more broadly across a Plex federation
- Discuss tools, rhythms, formats—building on the inter‑community newspaper ethos of the **Biweekly Plex Dispatch** *(you’re soaking in it!).*

**Schedule is still TBD**, so please email me at [**kaminski@istori.com**](mailto:kaminski@istori.com) with your interest and availability in those weeks. I’ll coordinate a couple of times that work for as many of us as possible.

Whether you’re a regular correspondent or just curious about what **cross‑community reporting** could look like, I’d love to hear from you. Let’s build together!
