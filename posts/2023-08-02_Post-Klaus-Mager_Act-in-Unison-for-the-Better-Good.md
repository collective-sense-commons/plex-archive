## Act in Unison for the Better Good
by **Klaus Mager**

I*’*m listening to Scott Galloway:

*[Image not included in the current archive. Images may be included in the future.]*

He has some solid insights that to most here are familiar themes. But at the core of it, look at the topics we have been discussing / sharing. They are all about defining the problem is ever so many ways. But truly, don*’*t we know and understand what is the issue by now? 

I love the thought process of Scott Galloway because he is trying to figure out what can drive us forward, how could we align and coordinate our actions? What would we need to know to move forward and act in unison for the better good?

Then I asked my ChatGPT 3.5 to write a poem for us wandering in the wilderness of thoughts:

In the shadows of despair, we stand,Witnessing a world slipping through our hands,
A climate shifting, a planet in pain,
Yet we find ourselves paralyzed, unable to gain.In streams of data, we drown and wade,
Endless knowledge, an ocean cascade,
How bad things are, we know too well,
But action eludes us, as if under a spell.With trembling hearts, we watch the signs,
The storms, the fires, the warming climes,
But overwhelmed, we hesitate to act,
Not knowing where to start, courage we lack.Yet deep within, a flicker resides,
A glimmer of hope that somehow abides,
For talent, skills, and connections await,
To rise above helplessness and change our fate.The time is now, the call rings clear,
To protect our communities, to hold them dear,
With unity, we*’*ll rise, our spirits high,
Mitigate, adapt, and not let hope die.Let*’*s weave a tapestry of dreams and plans,
Crafted together, hand in hand,
In every heart, a fire will burn,
To heal the wounds, the scars to turn.Engage the minds, ignite the will,
For Mother Earth, we must fulfill,
A duty bound, a promise made,
To leave a legacy that won*’*t fade.Let*’*s plant the seeds of hope and care,
Nurture the earth with love and prayer,
Embrace the challenge, stand tall, and strong,
For together, we shall right this wrong.No longer bound by helplessness*’*s shroud,
We*’*ll rise above, our voices loud,
For a future where life can thrive,
With hope, determination, we will survive.What comes to my mind is “[Time for Outrage: Indignez-vous!](https://www.amazon.com/Time-Outrage-Indignez-vous-St%C3%A9phane-Hessel/dp/1455509728),” a book by 93-old [Stéphane Hessel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St%C3%A9phane_Hessel)–a Resistance leader, concentration camp survivor, and former UN speechwriter.

Hessel reminds us that life and liberty must still be fought for. He urges us to reclaim those essential rights we have allowed our governments to diminish since the end of World War II.

In a parallel sense, watching the ongoing changes and deteriorations in our biosphere, it is clear that we are running out of time to act.

**The urgency could not be more pronounced.**
