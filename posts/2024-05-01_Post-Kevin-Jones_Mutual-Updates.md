## Mutual Updates
by **Kevin Jones**

I decided that **Act Local** was too limiting a frame. Stopped the classes; they didn’t want classes, they wanted to connect with a cause or campaign to get active with other people doing something they’d feel good about. Easy community engagement was the demand. I didn’t want to do that.

I am going to set up shop from 3-5 every Friday to do mutual updates, virtual and live in a little-used coffee shop in my community. Already got the key person, the Warren Wilson head of enviro science. We will check in on stuff we are doing around their **Guaranteed from Seed** suite of four biomedicinals. We want to use our **Give to Invest** platform to help the launch phase with that suite, for folks who know how to grow but don’t know what’s next. The check-ins can be virtual or in person. Most probably virtual, which is fine, if you design it that way.

Other younger people are taking the lead on these things. I’m just putting the partnerships together, and paying for some market research, etc. Eagle Market Streets CDC, my long time partner, is the anchor of this new thing too. Stephanie has let two of my ideas become real on her philanthropic investment platform, now.
