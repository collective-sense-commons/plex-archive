## Why Gardenworld?
by **Douglass Carmichael**

The core idea of Gardenworld.

After the first major effects of climate change are felt those people affected will be struggling to make sure they have food and shelter. Of course, powerful disrupted effects are already being felt in coastal places that are flooding and central places that are burning. Jobs are being lost because of a combination of climate and technologies such as robots and AI. 

The overall label for this has been climate change, but it is increasingly clear that this is a mislabeling. Climate is not the cause but the symptom of a badly managed society relying too heavily on management by economics which tends to enrich the rich while pushing the poor into poverty. The control of this dysfunctional economic management of society is Big Oil, but also Big Pharma, Big Tech, and Big Banks. We can add big construction like Vinci in France and Bechtel in the US and big agriculture such as Cargill.

Whatever emerging dysfunctions we must face, local or global, people will need local solutions for basic things like food, shelter, water, and companionship. The Gardenworld idea is to provide people with a short-term and long-term sense of purpose that is plausible, visualizable, and attractive.

But we find it hard to engage people in this vision since daily life still seems okay. If it appears to be going wrong, the politicians should step in and fix it, which is unlikely because there is no “it” for them to implement, given that everything is interconnected.

With clarity about mega causes and serious global effects in mind and conscious, we can turn to thinking strategically about what we are going to do. When things are falling apart there is not much to do to stop it. (Though if you have a good idea try it out and if it seems to work try to recruit others) Hard thinking must shift to “now what?” thinking. But let immediate concerns be guided by long range goals.
