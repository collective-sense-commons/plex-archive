## "Augmented Intelligence" Instead?
by **Klaus Mager**

When we talk about AI tools, ChatGPT, amazing texts being generated by AI, is that really useful when seen as 'artificial' intelligence? Would it not make more sense to be seen and considered as 'augmented' intelligence?

What comes to mind:

[There’s a catch](https://www.techtarget.com/iotagenda/blog/IoT-Agenda/Augmented-vs-artificial-intelligence-Whats-the-difference) — true artificial intelligence does not exist and will not exist for at least a decade, even though the AI industry is predicted to be worth nearly $3 billion this year alone. Because of this reality, it begs the question: If we aren’t currently experiencing true AI, then how can we categorize the current state of advanced algorithms and technology? The answer is simple. Right now, we’re living in the era of *augmented intelligence*.

[Augmented intelligence](https://bdtechtalks.com/2017/12/04/what-is-the-difference-between-ai-and-augmented-intelligence/) (AI), also referred to as intelligence augmentation (IA) and cognitive augmentation, is a complement—not a replacement—to human intelligence. It’s about helping humans become faster and smarter at the tasks they’re performing. At its core, augmented intelligence is not technically different from what’s already being presented as AI. It is a rather different perspective on technological advances, especially those that allow computers and software to participate in tasks that were thought to be the exclusive to humans.

The reason I think this is an important distinction is its influence on the design phase. Social systems change requires people changing their mind, enabling behavioral adaptations. Instead of 'artificial' intelligence outlining what must be done, augmented intelligence will inform and create a deeper understanding of the as is scenarios facing humanity on an emotional level where change happens.
