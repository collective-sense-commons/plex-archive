## Venture Philanthropy: Giving To Invest
by **Kevin Jones**

All three of the initiatives I am deeply engaged in hinge on a tool i am helping to resurrect and revive: **venture philanthropy,** or â€œgiving to invest".

- The watershed fund for affordable loans to local farmers.
- The micro economy around a college aiming to become a work college, thereby enabling students to graduate without debt. This project includes a game designer many of us know, as well as my favorite creative underwriter.
- Tackling the challenge faced by Black fund managers in accessing donor-advised fund owners.

With venture philanthropy, the money from the gift comes back and goes out again as another loan to someone in your community, and keeps doing that.

You realize your impact over time, and maybe want to be a part of it.

This is a collective climate change response mechanism that we are aiming for, replicable in the places where there is the right ecosystem.

You can use venture philanthropy, in tandem with crowdfunding, anywhere there is a community that cares about an issue, that has a bit of persistence, and who are willing to invest with a deep dose of reciprocity within an economic bioregion or vertical issue with good dimensionality.
