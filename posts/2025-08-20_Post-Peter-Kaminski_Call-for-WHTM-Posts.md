## Call for “WHTM” Posts
by **Peter Kaminski**

Hi, this is Pete, your friendly Plex editor and publisher.

On one of my old online haunts—a mailing list called WORDS-L—we had a tradition called “WHTM” (What Happened To Me).

A WHTM was often a travelogue, a slice-of-life story, or a personal milestone. Sometimes it was a family visit, a vacation, or a work trip; other times it was a funny moment in a store, an airport misadventure, or even a memorial service. The common thread: each WHTM helped us know the writer more personally—beyond the usual list backs and forths—and share in one another’s lives.

I’d love to bring that tradition to the Plex. Share your WHTM! If you’d like help deciding if a story is share-worthy (spoiler: it probably is), email me at [kaminski@istori.com](mailto:kaminski@istori.com).
