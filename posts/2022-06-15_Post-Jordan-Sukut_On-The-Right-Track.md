## On The Right Track
by **Jordan Sukut**

Hello from the Lionsberg | Meta Project teams!

We are juggling a busy couple weeks and making some great progress.

If you are interested in joining our Wednesday calls, the schedule is as follows:

12:20 PT – Coffee and Community
12:30 PT – Silent Prayer and Meditation
12:35 PT – Navigation Meeting
2:00 PT – Retro and Next Steps
2:30 PT – Close

Over the last couple weeks we rolled our sleeves up and made tremendous progress growing in our shared understanding and articulation of 1) structure 2) patterns of decentralization and federation, and 3) inviting everyone to engage with at least one emergent [Group / Sovereign]. We had a great call pushing this into minimum viable form on 6/15, and we are on the right track!

This week we assigned teams to work over the next 2-3 weeks to advance our remaining objectives for this cycle:

- A minimum viable working declaration or constitution
- A minimum viable Integrated Delivery System
- Resourcing the critical path

The most difficult of those three will be resourcing. If you see value in what is emerging and would like to help, please reach out to Jordan at J@Lionsberg.org.

As we get through these next few steps, we will be in a fantastic position heading into Q3. Thank you so much to everyone who is participating and contributing.

With Love, In Community,
~ the Lionsberg | Meta Project community / team of teams
