## Food, Agriculture and Climate Change, a GPT
by **Klaus Mager**

The risks inherent in our global food system are increasing exponentially, caused by droughts, floods, storms, and the loss of crop yields due to deteriorating soils. While there is little attention on this topic in the US-based media, international media is increasingly focused as we can see on the [Al Jazeera YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=al+jazeera+climate+food+supply).

My recent newsletter ‘[Thoughts About Food](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/thoughts-food-klaus-mager-m41xc/)’ is also focused on the risks inherent in our food system. Yet informing the public has been a challenge, and the election noise is taking all the oxygen out of the public discourse. Project Drawdown has (finally) come to the realization that food is a) the major issue, and b) takes the participation of the general public to solve. When I say ‘the major issue’, the industrial food system has damaged millions of acres of soil and watersheds with chemicals and mono-cropping practices, causing the loss of biodiversity, major droughts and floods.

Here is a GPT trained to answer any related questions you may have: [ChatGPT - Food, Agriculture and Climate Change](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-5LmmLEKZg-food-agriculture-and-climate-change). In case the answers are not clear or are insufficient, please drop me a note and I’ll update it accordingly. The GPT will respond in a conversational style to your questions.
