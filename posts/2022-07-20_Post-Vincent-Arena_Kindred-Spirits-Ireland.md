## Kindred Spirits Ireland

**Kindred Spirits Ireland 2022** is a 4-day hybrid conference that started Tuesday with a celebration of international generosity and humanity. The Irish People, delegates from Ireland and representatives from the Navajo and Hopi Nations came together to share stories about the hardships of the pandemic that were lessened in part by a flood of support by thousands of Irish citizens.

The unique bond between the Irish people and the First Nations dates back to the 1800s when the Choctaw Nations sent money and food to Ireland during the potato famine, although they were also struggling themselves. This generosity was repaid generations later when over 29,000 Irish donated over a million dollars during the Covid-19 pandemic to the [**Navajo and Hopi Peoples Covid-19 Relief Fund**](https://navajohopisolidarity.org/).

The conference builds upon this theme and implores us to think about the ways in which we can have difficult conversations, find what is in common, and collaborate across cultures and oceans.
