## Stop Making Sense-Making!
by **Gil Friend** and **Ken Homer**

Dear fellow Earthling,

[Here’s the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GtRDUvByac&list=PL202gED-y1zOml0saofx2Nk3E3ES28TMt&index=3) of our September 20th session of Living Between Worlds, with Grace, Dignity, and Power. 

The current popularity of “sense-making” puzzles and amuses us. It seems an impulse toward something clear and settled…something that may not be available to us in these times.

In this month’s conversation, we explored the challenge and opportunity of what Aviva Zornberg calls “spiritual vertigo.” What Simone Biles calls “the twisties”—“when your brain and body disconnect,” when you’re spinning in mid-air, not sure how, or if, you’ll be able to land. What Bayo Akomolafe calls being “generously lost.”

That’s where we started. [Watch or listen to the recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GtRDUvByac&list=PL202gED-y1zOml0saofx2Nk3E3ES28TMt&index=3) to find out (or review) where we went. (And please: “like!” and “subscribe!”—it trains the YouTube algorithms to treat us more kindly.)

And we hope you’ll join us for our next session Wednesday October 18th, and on the third Wednesday of the month in the months to come.

The next ***“Living Between Worlds”*** webinar:

12-1:30p PT, October 18th (and every third Wednesday)
