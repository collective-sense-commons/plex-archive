## Lionsberg: The Adventure Continues
by **Jordan Sukut**

In Q1 + April, Lionsberg:

- Published the [Lionsberg Manifesto](https://lionsberg.wiki/lionsberg_manifesto)
- Improved the [New Vision and Plan](https://lionsberg.wiki/new_vision_and_plan)
- Developed a gamified substructure for the movement via [The Great Game of Lionsberg](https://lionsberg.wiki/lionsberg_wiki_books/the_great_game_of_lionsberg/the_great_game_of_lionsberg)
- Deepened relationships with South America and indigenous communities (Jordan traveled to Amazon)
- Deepened relationships with the independent political movement in the US (Jordan traveled to convention in Austin)
- Added hundreds of pages to the [Lionsberg Wiki](https://lionsberg.wiki/) clarifying numerous aspects
- Launched the Lionsberg Platform at [https://community.lionsberg.org](https://community.lionsberg.org/) (invitation only for now)
- Launched the Lionsberg Chat System at [https://chat.lionsberg.org](https://chat.lionsberg.org/) (invitation only for now)
- Reached agreement with **Procore** to provide their platform the Movement as an in-kind donation to Lionsberg (Program Management and Project / Grant Pursuit and Administration)
- Set up an enterprise node of **Oracle P6** for Program Management
- Set up the **Above The Chaos** podcast across multiple platforms (please feel free to refer guests!)
- Clarified Strategy
- Developed a more sophisticated fundraising strategy around the joint pursuit of multiple larger grants to fund specific parts of the movement across a range of partner organizations
- Tentatively identified a first $1.2M grant to pursue (See *NSF Grant* elsewhere in this issue)
- Identified a core group to begin the next phase
- Identified a core set of emerging business opportunities to explore the potential to start the economic federation

We **did not** successfully execute on our 120 day goal to secure funding, partly because I did not ask. Based on the feedback I received, I chose not to initiate fundraising meetings until we could accomplish the steps and above to clarify the structure, process, and plan. Instead, we chose to further clarify, plan, publish, assemble infrastructure and find new participants.

With the additional steps above and the new energy engaged, we began as scheduled this first week of May, and will be building teams and pursuing resources in a more targeted manner with a broader range of partners.

If you would like to get involved in this next phase of the adventure, please reach out to [Jordan](mailto:j@lionsberg.org) or [Pete](mailto:kaminski@istori.com).

Love and blessings to you all!

With love, in community,

~ Jordan
