## The Networks Festival
by **Vincent Arena**

Plex folks, there is an awesome month-long event about the power of networks happening now! Thereâ€™s going to be a session on May 25th that **Catalist** and others will be presenting at: [Network platforms showcase #2](https://www.tickettailor.com/events/fitonetwork/918829?).

More information can be found at the links below. Registration for the main events happens on the **Fito** network site. **Catalist** is being used to show the calendar and also the repository of videos and content after the event, as well as letting people submit local and virtual adventures (their own sessions). All events that require registration can be accessed on either site!
