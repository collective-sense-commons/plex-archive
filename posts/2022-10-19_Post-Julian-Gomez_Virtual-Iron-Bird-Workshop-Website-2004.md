## Virtual Iron Bird Workshop Website (2004)
by **Julian Gómez**

I’ve finished re-creating the **2004 NASA Virtual Iron Bird Workshop** website. Actually, it’s not a re-creation, but a compendium of what were multiple segments.

Placing it as a website at the Internet Archive is turning out to be problematic, so several members of the FJB community have offered to help find a home for it, with solutions such as **IPFS**.

*More reading:* [NASA Gets a New Fix on Problems](https://www.wired.com/2002/02/nasa-gets-a-new-fix-on-problems/) (Wired, 2002) - “Driven by an Oracle database, a computerized simulator will allow engineers to create what-if scenarios on spacecraft, instead of having to build mockups.”
