## Breath of Fire–Winter 2007
by **Ken Homer**

*[ed. note–if you enjoy these stories from Ken's life, send him a thank-you at *kenhomer @ sonic.net* – I know he'd appreciate it!]*

It was a typical February day
Here in the Bay Area
A damp fog clung to the trees
There was a hint of a breeze
Temps in the high 40s to the low 50s

I drove to the end of the road
To the trailhead at Baltimore Canyon
A favorite hiking spot of mine
I sat in my car and took two hits 
From a joint before getting out
As I was walking toward the trail
Two women were coming off it
Shall I give him the stuff?
The other answered in the affirmative

I was taken aback
They had to be talking about me
No one else was around
The younger of the two
Approached me while the 
Other one went to their car
And began rummaging in the trunk
There’s a woman on the trail
Maybe half a mile in
She sprained her ankle quite badly
Would you take her some warm things?

I told them I’d be happy to
The other woman came over
Handed me a parka and windbreaker
Thank you she said
We’re off to get the paramedics

I set out at a rapid pace
Which soon had me quite warm
I reached the injured woman quickly
She was lean and fit in her mid-40s
Dressed in a singlet and running shorts
She was laying on the wet ground 
Right beside the creek
Her bare arms and legs were exposed
To the damp and the chill February air
Her lips were blue and her teeth were
Chattering so badly I could
Hardly understand her when she spoke
She was shivering uncontrollably

I did my best not to appear too alarmed
I looked at her feet
Saw that her left ankle
Was hideously swollen
A good two or three times
The size of her right one

Hi I’m Ken and I’m here 
To get you warm and 
Keep you company
Until the paramedics arrive
What’s your name?
Despite her violent shivering
She managed to stammer Dolores

Okay Dolores why don’t
You put this windbreaker on and
With your permission I’m going to
Carefully remove your shoes 
Then I’m going help you
Slide your legs into the sleeves 
Of this parka to help to warm you
That will give you some insulation
Against the damp ground
Which is sucking heat out of you
Is that okay with you?

Just be careful of my ankle please
I promise I will be gentle
I can see that it’s a bad sprain
I managed to untie and 
Remove her sneakers
I carefully guided her feet
Into the sleeves of the parka
And pulled it up under her
So that her lower body 
Was no longer on the bare ground

Do you run here often?
Several times a week
I was on the King Mountain trail
(King Mtn is the hill above the canyon)
How long have you been laying here?
Maybe half an hour or 45 minutes
No wonder you’re freezing!

My husband is gonna kill me 
When he hears about this!

Let’s focus on getting you warm
Before we worry about your husband
I’m concerned about your shivering 
And the fact that your lips are blue
I think I have a way to warm you up
Is it okay if I put my hands
On the bottom of your feet?
I promise not to hurt your ankle

Anything that will warm me up
Is okay with me I’ve never felt so cold!

I can see that you are quite chilled
I am going to do some breathwork
You don’t need to do anything
You can just relax and if you want
You can match your breath to mine

At this point I’d had about three years
Of private chi kung lessons
I knew I could generate 
A lot of heat for myself
But I didn’t know if I could
Use it to warm up another person

I knelt down and gently lifted
Her feet into my lap
Is this okay?
She nodded yes
I placed my hands flat against
The soles of her feet

I’m just going to breath now
My breaths will probably be
Too deep to match exactly
Why don’t you try taking two breaths 
For every one of mine?
She nodded

I began to breathe as 
Deeply as I could
Inhaling and exhaling through my nose
While focusing on my belly
I visualized a blazing fire filling my body
With flames moving down my arms

After about 15 minutes of this
Dolores stopped shivering
Her lips returned to a normal color

Oh my god! Oh my god!
I don’t know what you are doing
But I am completely warm now
I feel like I am sitting beside
A roaring fire wrapped in a blanket!
I am actually starting to sweat!
How are you able to do this?
This is totally amazing!

I can’t really explain it Dolores
I have been training in an old
Chinese art called chi kung
It has properties that our way of thinking
Lacks adequate language to describe
But as you can see it works!

I could now hear the paramedics
They would be there in a minute
As I was still quite buzzed
I didn’t want to be seen by them

I’m going to go now Dolores
But do me a favor will you?
Get yourself a good metal whistle
And carry it with you when you run
If you had sprained your ankle 
Up on King Mountain it might
Have been hours before anyone 
Came along to find you
You’re lucky you were down here
On the canyon path which is
Quite well traveled
Will you do that?

That’s a great idea
Thank you!

I’m going to leave you in good hands
The paramedics are almost here
You take care now
I headed off down the trail
Just as the paramedics arrived
