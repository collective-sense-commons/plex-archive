## Marley
by **Jerry Michalski**

*reposted from the OGM Wiki: [Marley](https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/marley)*

Although it has nothing to do with dogs or pets in general, this project is named **Marley** in honor of Stacey Druss’s late shaggy dog of that name. We keep his memory going when we talk about this project.

Project Marley started with [Pete's Original OGM Topics Proposal](https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/Pete), which was a challenge to OGM to write an edited volume book. That’s a book where each chapter is contributed by a different writer, but the chapters together work as a book.

Our first goal is to co-write a [Quick First Book](https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/Quick_First_Book.html), getting the basic elements in place to go from Markdown files to a published ePub or Kindle File Format book. We need to pick that first book’s topic and contents soon.

After that book is published, we will escalate things, convening book-writing teams and exploring the book ideas’ intersections, so the books might share “nuggets” of content.

We refer to “books” with a bit of tongue in cheek, because conventional books are inert and obsolete. So:

Books are known cultural objects: shiny, attractive media that anyone can understand.

Books serve as an inviting entry point to a vast array of captivating online resources, such as:

- Live discussions (both real-time and over time)
- Further resources, should you want to act on a Nugget’s advice
- Constantly updated content that reflects our growing knowledge and understanding

To co-write several intersecting books, we will need to develop [Roles](https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/OGM_Topics_Ops/Roles.html), a [Marley Work Flow](https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/Marley%20Work%20Flow), a [Design Bible](https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/OGM_Topics_Ops/Design_Bible.html) and a [Marley FAQ](https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/Marley%20FAQ) to explain outstanding questions.
