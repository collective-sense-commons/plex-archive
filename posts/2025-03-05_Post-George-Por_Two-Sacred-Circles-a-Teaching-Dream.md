Our gaze rests on each other’s eyes. Her shiny, deep-brown iris glows with the fire of her soul. She speaks with profound resolve and softly.

 I don’t remember all the words she uttered in the dream, but they were words of passionate yearning for evermore dwelling in the One and the One in her.

 Her intent look and soft-power voice vibrate in me, stirring a resonant response. She reaches out and holds my hands. It’s silent communion. Subtle energies course through our bodies in a circular pattern from me to her, from her to me, back and forth, until there’s only one ecstatic movement.
