## SeaCHANGE with Beth Tener
by **John Abbe**

### Online Event, June 30
*Free registration: [Beth Tener: Unlocking community potential](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/beth-tener-unlocking-community-potential-tickets-652615790397) (Eventbrite)*

The guest for this month’s **Real World Co-Intelligence** call is **Beth Tener,** of **New Directions Collaborative and Kinship Hub.** Ms. Tener has consulted to hundreds of organizations and networks on collaboration and systemic change. This call on June 30th, from 10am-noon Pacific time, will focus on Beth’s work as co-designer and co-host of the SeaCHANGE conference - Reshaping Tomorrow through Creativity & Community. Last year was the first time this distinctive and highly participatory conference was offered, to explore how communities can work with the arts for healing and social change and amplify the work of BIPOC artists.

Beth will share her learning from last year’s conference, and her thoughts on planning this year’s upcoming conference, which will be taking place in August. For more information–including a video from last year’s conference–and to register for the call, see: [https://www.eventbrite.com/e/beth-tener-unlocking-community-potential-tickets-652615790397](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/beth-tener-unlocking-community-potential-tickets-652615790397)

CII's monthly Real World Co-Intelligence calls offer a participatory learning community format. They are also recorded so we can share our learnings with others. In each call, we include a section where we offer some explicit connections between the practice we are exploring, and the patterns and principles of co-intelligence and wise democracy. These calls are offered as a gift from the Co-Intelligence Institute. If you feel moved to support our work financially you can do so here: [https://www.co-intelligence.institute/donate](https://www.co-intelligence.institute/donate)
