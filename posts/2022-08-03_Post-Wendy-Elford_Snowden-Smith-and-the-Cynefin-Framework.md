## Snowden, Smith and the Cynefin Framework Down Under
by **Wendy Elford**

There’s been plenty of good and bad and a very messy in between with the pandemic. One of the better outcomes is that communities worked on their projects online, people found the time to slow down, read or connect in other ways.

Now there’s more travel happening, **Dave Snowden, Beth Smith** and **Cynefin Framework-oriented** people in Australia and New Zealand are getting together face to face and **Wendy E** is getting close enough to a lot of the action to be able to share some of what is popping up after all of that 2020-2022 incubation.

Last week, Dave spoke at an event on the [EU Field Guide](https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/712438d0-8c55-11eb-b85c-01aa75ed71a1) at KPMG where he spoke about the latest addition to how the [Cynefin Framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_waoADNcaBU) can be applied in times of uncertainty. We did [Constraint](https://cynefin.io/wiki/Constraints) Mapping using our Covid experiences as a starting point – what worked well? What worked, but would not next time? What didn’t work? One of the things we discovered in our group was that if we made our ideas too abstract we got stuck. We needed smaller, person-sized and experience-based answers to those questions to pick out and map those constraints in a way that allowed us actions to take.

Below is an example of a map our group created:

*[Image not included in the current archive. Images may be included in the future.]*

The bottom left is where actions taken would be too volatile to risk – the top right is where actions would be too slow or too expensive / awkward etc so not the best place to start. So in short, lots to share.

Next week there is an event on **Local Self Reliance for Communities,** half a day on simulation and a two day workshop on Design. The following week is an event on **Indigenous knowledge systems** meets a more **western oriented set of methodologies.** And a three day retreat 17th – 20th August  on **Community Engagement** with a strong design and Indigenous issues component. You can join the retreat virtually ([paid – link to registration](https://thecynefin.co/product/virtual-retreat-watchstream/)) - to be part of the action and follow up discussions. We will be using **SenseMaker**. If anyone wants to know more about what is happening and to ask about the retreat message **Wendy Elford** on Mattermost or email [wendy@wendyelford.com](mailto:wendy@wendyelford.com).

All in all – many good people coming together to make the world a better place.
