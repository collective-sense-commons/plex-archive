## OGM Sense Doing
by **Peter Kaminski**

The [OGM mailing list](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfNY_K88JLK0FOSmV5ulYYYdX6_n_HZ9TARZM0RcsisZbrOSQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) (signup form for closed Google Group) crackled with activity the past two weeks, nearing 300 emails posted.

Some of the discussion (COVID-19, Twitter Files, among others) pushed the group into a meta discussion about how we know what we know, and what [Open Global Mind](https://openglobalmind.com/) really is. Join the mailing list at the link above, if you'd like to join the conversations and read the archives there.

OGM has several offshoot projects already (including Fellowship of the Link, Free Jerry's Brain, and others, depending how you count). A new one, currently called *“***Sense Doing**” may be forming, around the practice of, or perhaps practical, sensemaking. Join the [SenseDoing channel](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/ogm-sensedoing) (CSC Mattermost) for the latest discussion and documents-in-draft.

Some framing for different types of participants, to know about each other and understand why the conversation my not always pertain to them (collated by [**Bentley Davis** in the SenseDoing channel](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/imjixppgw7rj5kxpukmnw63efe)):

- People interested in sensemaking about a specific topic or event but who will probably not be interested in other topics;
- People interested in volunteering on the meta tasks of the SenseDoing project itself, such as IT tools for the group;
- People interested in sensemaking methods and want to practice, design, document, and/or test these methods.

Quick take by **Jack Park:** My comments for now [on] the domain of *“*sense doing”; based on a lively FJB zoom, I can see the potential for some sort of new motion taking roots. We talked about the limitations of existing platforms such as email, Mattermost, and so forth; we talked about enhancements to Zoom - or Jitsi, etc - in the name of improving collaborative opportunities, and we talked about mechanisms for building on those platforms, and on TheBrain, in, to use Jerry's term, a *“*seamful” way of navigation among platforms.
