## Call for Progressive Political Activism Resources
by **Peter Kaminski**

Do you have pointers to any progressive political activism resources, such as [Indivisible.org](https://indivisible.org/) or Heather Cox Richardson's Substack, [Letters from an American](https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/)?

Send one or many pointers to me at [kaminski@istori.com](mailto:kaminski@istori.com).

Please no bare links to resources; write a paragraph or two about why this resource, what it means to you in your life, other ideas you have or actions you're taking, etc.

Let's change the world,
â€“Pete
