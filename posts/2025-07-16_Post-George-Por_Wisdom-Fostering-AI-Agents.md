## Wisdom-Fostering AI Agents
by **George Pór**

Recently, I was appointed to serve as a [Distinguished Fellow at Schumacher](https://schumacherinstitute.org.uk/distinguished-fellows/#member-32170-info). This Fall, I plan to lead a 4-semester, invitational Action Research webinar series about **Co-Evolving with Wisdom-Fostering AI Agents.** Detailed information will be published by the end of the month on the program’s website.

Somebody asked, who will be eligible to apply for an invitation?  Below is a section of the draft syllabus.

**IS IT FOR YOU?**

Maybe. You decide. You are certainly eligible to be invited if:

- You are attracted to work on three planes of evolution — personal, communal, and planetary
- Inspired more by facilitated, collaborative learning (capability development) than traditional academic knowledge transfer
- Your relationship with the possibility of wisdom-fostering AI agents falls into the blue zone
