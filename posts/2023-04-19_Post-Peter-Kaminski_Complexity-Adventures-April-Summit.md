## Complexity Adventures April Summit
by **Michael Lennon** and **Peter Kaminski**

[Complexity Adventures](https://www.complexityadventures.com/) is a group of people who came together for regular meetings around the topic of complexity. A marvelous outcome of their work together are their biannual summits, which are 48-hour around-the-clock online unconference events. They also host monthly basecamps for self-organized groups of participants to join together in their meeting space to keep the conversations going.

The next summit is coming up soon, April 28-30. Free registration is here: [https://bit.ly/CASummitApril2023](https://bit.ly/CASummitApril2023)

The event is for scientists, visual artists, musicians, people interested in people, philosophers, epistemologists, and more, who want to learn more about complexity, systems science, and science of networks, and who want to mix and mingle with other complexity-minded people. 1/3 of attendees are beginners who are new to complexity and the group, so donâ€™t let being new hold you back from attending.

The summit happens in Gather.town, an online meeting venue. The format is one hour of session, then one hour of flexible time for mingling, for 48 hours straight. Every time zone, attendees from 55 countries. Attend the sessions that are of interest to you.
