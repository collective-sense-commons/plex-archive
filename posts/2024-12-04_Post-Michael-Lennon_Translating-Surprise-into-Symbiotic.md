## Translating Surprise into Symbiotic Mutualism
by **Michael Lennon**

*Michael's session from the 4th Applied Active Inference Symposium*

### Me2We2All: Translating Surprise into Symbiotic Mutualism
**A conversation about Re-vitalizing Organizational Symbiosis and Re-negotiating flourishing within, between and beyond familiar boundaries**

Session on YouTube: [Co-inferencing Organizational Symbiosis (1h 59m 35s)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee6_mNOfP38&t=7175s)

*Here’s my prepared outline, which I expect will continue to evolve—possibly growing into a full chapter or even a short book. Your questions, comments, and feedback are welcome.*

- **PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS IS MISUNDERSTOOD**: Human happiness is influenced more reliably by SOCIAL and Environmental factors than by INDIVIDUAL traits.Similarly with flourishing of human collectives, external relational dynamics influence more heavily than dynamics within the collective alone.
- Just as the intuition that the sun circles the earth was incorrect, the belief in the reliability of Individualism is over-applied.

- **New understanding of systemic disease as collective (relational) dysfunction**Cancer as cellular trauma: Traumatized cells over-consume and reproduce excessively to the point of strangling their host.
- New treatment for healing cancer: instead of punitive killing of traumatized cells, new informational interventions “call parasitic cancer cells back into symbiotic relation” with neighbor cells.

- **Healing Organizational (Economic) Cancer**: The mal-adapted corporation (or the disease of “Mono-Capitalism”)Corporations (& liberal capitalism) started in the 1600's as self-assembling symbiotic groups joining to achieve together what individuals alone could not.
- Many once symbiotic corporations have become disconnected with their originating local communities, prioritizing by law relations with and for stockholders. The “mono-focus” upon financial returns over other forms of living capital has driven corporations to become “relationally inbred” towards the rest of their living capitals. And as cancer does to the body, disconnected corporations are over-consuming environmental, civic, social and collective commons at the expense of the overall system—the planet.

- **Informational solution for Organizations**: Calling organizations back into more skillful and diversified Relation (Amplifying mutualism from “mono-capitalism” (“extraction”) back to multi-capitalism (“symbiosis”))Building new organizational forms and inter-organizational forms symbiotic with Peers, Place and Life
- Recovery / regenerate relational capacity throughout organizations and inter-organizations (e.g. marketplaces) to practice and harmonize around multi-capitalism / relational capitalism instead of mono-capitalism

- **Active Inference (AIF) is a biology-derived pattern language for continuously adaptive distributed learning and synchronization.** AIF can help existing and emerging groups to co-sense, co-predict and co-adapt much dynamically and holistically than traditional hierarchyAIF offers existing or emerging organizations new ways to learn collectivelyFrom Correcting Error to Co-Learning from Surprise more skillfully
- New and “informationally leaner” ways to monitor, co-predict and co-adapt
- Informationally more efficient ways to collectively monitor and learn from the emergent or unknown (e.g. inter-relationships, perspectival diversity, scope of attentional perspective, flows, pattern monitoring..)

- **Fair Sharing Commons is a similarly biology-informed form of Organizational Mutualism**A pattern-based approach to practicing symbiosis within, between and beyond organizations
- Similar to LINUX, build both commons for all, as well as, support the
- FSC (EvoluteSix, Me2we2all, and allies) – A relational, self-governing business model and platform

- **Invitation: Prototyping AIF-oriented Fair Sharing Commons (FSC) for symbiotic innovation, sense-making and venturing within, between and beyond the familiar AIF patterns**Constitute Fair-Sharing Commons (FSC) for Active Inference-related prosocial ventures, supporting the growth of the AIF commons, as well as, ventures prototyping and development Self-Assembling Mutualism, prototyping a commons for AIF-inspired ventures
- Proto-type agent for accelerating access to and engagement with funding (BFF)
- Proto-type Agent for connecting to competence & complementary capabilities and cultivating Personal, Inter-personal, inter-organizational and inter-ecosystemic symbiotic competence
