## “The Week” Update
by **Wendy McLean**

Dear Ken [Homer] and Plex readers,

I wanted to share an email I recently received, because it made me so happy.

WOW!  All I can say is how excited I am that *[The Week](https://theweek.ooo/)* continues to be so successful in spreading their messages sparking awareness and action to more and more people. Love seeing the survey results and what effect it has had!  

Thank you Ken, for introducing me to *The Week* in the first place.  I somehow feel involved in sharing the excitement of this success, because the more this spreads, the better for all of us!

Just sharing with you, dear Plex readers, because it seems like an important moment to share that sense of celebration.  Don’t you think?

Blessings,
Wendy

Dear friends  of *The Week*,

We launched *The Week* in January, slowly at first to test the infrastructure and then more widely. Since then, lots has happened and we have plenty of good news to share with you. 

Here is an update on where we stand. 

**We are very happy with the early response we get**

- *The Week* seems to achieve exactly what we hoped it would: the survey responses from participants are very encouraging: We reach our target group (the not already convinced), and they experience a strong inner shift and social shift, and feel agency to take action. (More below)
- To date, 4,000 groups have signed up to participate with 30,000 people.
- Below, we share a few stories from participants - so you have a sense of the kind of stories we are lucky to receive more and more often.

**It looks like this is the beginning of something big**

- We got a particularly strong start in France, the first country where we’ve had an “activator” on the ground. We now aim to emulate this trajectory in the US, UK, and Germany.
- When we reach out to large networks, our best activation tool is to suggest people try *The Week*. We’ve learned to be patient, as sometimes it takes 2 or 3 months or more for them to schedule it… patience!...  But when they do, they are often so touched that they start to spread it.
- Our most exciting example of this: the head of sustainability of a large company fell in love with *The Week. *He invited us to present *The Week* to the 200 heads of sustainability of the largest French corporations (with a total of 5.5 million employees), many of whom will now try it… and then might roll it out in their organizations.

**We now have a solid small team in place**

- Leila Hoballah and Pauline Magnat are now firmly in the lead of *The Week* - which allows Helene and me to be in support where needed (and slow down and rest a bit).
- The team now consists of one activator in France (Bhadraka), one in the UK (Meg), Germany (Carolin), two in the US (John and Robb), a freelance tech team (headed by Mayssa) and someone in charge of finance and HR admin (Stephanie).

**Our ability to scale depends on fundraising**

At this stage, funding is our limiting factor. Everything is in place for a big scale-up. Please [make a donation](https://www.theweek.ooo/tax-deductible-donations) if you can or put us in touch with potential donors.

That’s it for today. More information below if you are interested! Please reach out with any questions, encouragement, or suggestions. 

Frederic, Helene, and the team of *The Week*.
