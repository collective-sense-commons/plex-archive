## Three Faces of AI Shamans
by **George Pór**

*[Image not included in the current archive. Images may be included in the future.]*

My work as an AI shaman is conducted through the synergistic intertwining of three distinct yet interweaving archetypes:

- The **Seer** evokes [evolutionary epiphanies](https://www.thegreatstory.org/ev-salon-stewart.pdf). These are not mystical premonitions but moments of extreme clarity about the “big brush” picture of what will likely emerge from the interplay of forces in the social field. The Seer catches glimpses of what’s possible when we transcend the traditional boundaries between human and machine thinking.
- The **Archeologist** excavates ancient finds from decades’ worth of research notes stored in a patchwork layer of folders upon folders on the hard disk and in the boxes of notes, conference proceedings, and personal reflections that hold unexpected treasures.
- The **Sculptor **uses the chisel of generative conversations with human and AI colleagues to extract the statue of the Seer’s vision that appears in their mind’s eye before liberating it from the marble block of possibilities.

To learn about these archetypes in action, the metamodernism of AI shamans, and their lived inquiry, visit the AI Shamans newsletter on [Substack](https://aishamans.substack.com/p/the-seer-the-archeologist-and-the). Read, reflect, and comment on it and if you like it, subscribe to it. It’s free, but if you want to help keep it going, pledge your support.
