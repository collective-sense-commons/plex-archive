## LBW Technosophical Conversation about AI
by **Peter Kaminski**

On March 19th, Gil and Ken hosted me on their **Living Between Worlds** call, with part one of a technosophical conversation about AI. The recording is here:

Part one was mostly presentation, and part two will be mostly discussion. Part two is coming up on April 16th, register here:

I'm also posting daily “homework” exercises five days a week until the next call. I try to provide some interesting ways to learn more about LLMs by doing. We're halfway through, but feel free to skim the past days, and subscribe for the rest:
