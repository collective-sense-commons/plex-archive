## Real World Co-Intelligence with Indra Adnan
by **John Abbe**

On Friday, May 26, the **Co-Intelligence Institute** (CII) continues our **Real World Co-Intelligence** calls with **Indra Adnan,** Founder and Co-initator of **The Alternative Global,** a socio-political platform serving systemic transformation. 10am-11:30pm Pacific, 1pm-2:30pm East, etc.

“If politics is broken, then… what is the Alternative?”

**CANs** (Citizen Action Networks) are place-based community action networks that bring people from local communities together across their differences. Participants include those who are committed to community organizing and those who have been traditionally excluded or disinterested; the intention to cooperate and collaborate in ways that create change for people and planet.

We’ll be interviewing Indra about her model for developing CANs, as well as the lessons she has learned along the way, about the work of being a systems convenor. Other topics will include Future Being, CANs of CANs, and News from Planet A. And as usual we will hear reflections from everyone, including CII founder **Tom Atlee,** on what our guest shares.
