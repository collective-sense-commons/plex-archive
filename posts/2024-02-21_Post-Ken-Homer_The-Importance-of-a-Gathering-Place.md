## The Importance of a Gathering Place
by **Ken Homer**

For years our friends Kiki and David 
Had the perfect party house
An enclosed courtyard in the front
A spacious deck in the back overlooking a creek
And in-between a house with a large living room
Commodious kitchen – a dining room table that seats 12

Plus Kiki is a fabulous cook
At least two to three times a month
She’d put the word out to the 3 or 4 couples
Who made up our inner circle
Bocce at 4PM followed by potluck at our house
She’d make an amazing main dish 
And we’d all bring sides
Wine flowed freely – weed was plentiful too

On special occasions – birthdays and holidays mainly
They’d host a party with up to 20 or 25 people
This went on for over a decade
It kept us all close and engaged in each other’s lives

Then came their announcement 
We are subletting our house 
We’re going to travel for a year
There was a big farewell party
There were tears too

Six months later they came back
This time with a different announcement:
We’ve decided to move to the Pacific Northwest 
(To be closer to the grandkids)
This is a permanent move

All of us were happy for them and sad for us
No one else has a house that can accommodate us all
Well, in the summer we meet at the bocce court
Or out at [Samuel P Taylor](http://parks.ca.gov/469) or on someone’s deck
But “party central” had closed with deleterious effects
On the couples who had so regularly gathered over the years

We still see each other - in smaller configurations
It’s not the same and it's not as often 
When we meet we talk about how much
We miss the good old days - which ain’t coming back

It’s amazing how the right place to meet
Can enhance or diminish a community
