## “Tools for Thinking” Events
by **Jerry Michalski**

I am helping [betaworks](http://betaworks.com/), a venture capital firm and accelerator based in New York City, produce a series of very OGMy events focused on **Tools for Thinking.** The first event is a hybrid, all-afternoon session on August 16, [**RENDER: Tools For Thinking**](https://www.betaworks.com/event/render-tools-for-thinking). There's a $100 fee for attending in person, unless you're developing Tools for Thinking. The livestream will be free. You're extremely welcome to participate, in any of these ways:

- [Register](https://www.betaworks.com/event/render-tools-for-thinking) and watch the livestream.
- If you're near NYC, attend the **Render** session!
- Built a Tool for Thinking? Apply for betaworks' **Think Camp,** which will run ten weeks this fall.
- Love using Tools for Thinking to map, annotate, weave and storytell? Join Jerry in [scribing](https://wiki.rel8.dev/scribing_tools_for_thinking) the event series.
