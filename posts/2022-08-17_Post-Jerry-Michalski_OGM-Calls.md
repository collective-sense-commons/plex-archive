# OGM Calls

**Author:** [[Jerry Michalski]]
**Issue:** [2022-08-17](https://plex.collectivesensecommons.org/2022-08-17/)

## OGM Calls
Thursdays at 8am Pacific Time, 11am Eastern Time, via Zoom. Check the [[ogm] Town Square channel](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/ogm-calls) header for the Zoom link, or email [Jerry](mailto:sociate@gmail.com).

The Open Global Mind Thursday calls alternate between “topic” and “check-in” calls. Jerry Michalski masterfully facilitates and weaves a heartful, soulful, thoughtful conversation around the topics that emerge from the 15 or so attendees each week.

You can get an idea of the format and the topics by perusing the hundred or so topic and check-in calls, mixed into the 195 videos in the [Open Global Mind YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLreQNsM8LqWA2ib_Yfkde8m30ANi0WtJr). Jerry also has a Jerry's Brain thought that links the call recordings and includes chats and transcripts, [OGM Zoom Calls (2020+ playlist, 114 calls)](https://bra.in/6jobWY).
