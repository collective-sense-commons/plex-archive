## Dent 2023
by **Julian Gómez**

[Dent 2023](https://dentthefuture.com/conference) was held in September. This conference is always a wild mashup of strikingly different disciplines. It ends up being highly relevant to FJB/OGM because the cross disciplinary connections foster ideas that can be very constructive. Unfortunately, there’s no post conference analysis of the subjects that were covered, but sometimes they post recordings of the sessions.

It would in fact be difficult to summarize Dent. The topics are so wide ranging, and the hallway and meal conversations likewise, that it would take an army of human recorders and editors to produce a summary. Some of the sessions, for example:

- La Fonda on the Plaza Art & History Tour
- Santa Fe Spy Tour
- How Magic Works
- Indigenous Futurisms: Transcending Past / Present / Future
- Culinary Alchemy: A Journey with Chef Fernando Olea
- The Unedited Lens: A Photographic Journey
- So Good They Can’t Ignore You with Lauren (Malibu Babie) Miller

One highlight this year was a tour of the old Los Alamos National Laboratory site, i.e. what it was like during the Manhattan Project, conducted by [Ellen Bradbury Reid](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/people/ellen-bradbury-reid/), who was a little girl then. Ellen’s father was responsible for XXXXXX XXXX XXXXXX XXXXXX in the Manhattan project.

The tour started with the Bradbury theater. I spent some time comparing photographs from 80 years ago to what I could see out the window. And in addition, I got to see a film clip of a B-29 backing up – that was a new one.

We then went to sites that were her world as a six year old, where she shared stories from a kid’s viewpoint. For example: General Groves’ mechanism for dealing with stress. A comment about the Oppenheimer’s house. And that the roads between Santa Fe and Los Alamos, and around the lab, were terrible. She said many of the wives expressed a sentiment that they would not venture on the road to Santa Fe again until the war was over. And this was directly related to how the road to test site TA-10 got paved. And what was the area called Bathtub Row?
