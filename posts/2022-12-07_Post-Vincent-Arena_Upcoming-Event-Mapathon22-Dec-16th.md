Mapathon is a 12-hour virtual gathering to explore new mapping projects, participate in interactive demonstrations, discuss and developing interoperability of data across maps, and evaluate the pros and cons of various mapping tools. The goal is to cross-pollinate mapping initiatives from many networks to catalyze collaboration amongst those creating maps to help us navigate towards a thriving planet.
