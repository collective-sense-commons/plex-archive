## Neighborhood Economics in Rural Canada
by **Kevin Jones**

I was just asked by a serious guy in my field to build a neighborhood economics style network across rural Canada. He has the chops and the contacts. He doesn't know how to build a network.

I like building networks. I hope to work with him to see  how easily replicable the solutions I've aggregated against a taxonomy of issues: innovative housing solutions, community owned commercial real estate, subverting structural injustice that's baked into how governments measure what a healthy community is, and who should get better services.

The chances that it won't work are high. But it will be fun to try, using influence, not direct executive power to design the template.
