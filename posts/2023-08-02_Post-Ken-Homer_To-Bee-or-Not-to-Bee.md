## To Bee or Not to Bee?
### Thoughts on the loss of tiny lives

When I moved into this apartment back in Dec of 2012, the patio was almost devoid of plant life. There were a couple of jasmine plants against the fence and three mature Japanese Maple trees – sadly lost two years ago to the rebuilding of a retaining wall. Surrounding the concrete of the patio was a ribbon of hardpacked soil with a high clay content. In Spring of 2013, I spent many hours and endured many blisters as I broke up that soil and added amendments and moisture control soil so that I could plant a garden. While I would like to have a vegetable garden it’s not really practical here. For one thing the patio borders driveways at either end and I don’t think the soil would be healthy for growing edible plants. There was also a huge amount of English ivy on the retaining wall that played home to a mischief of rats, and they always managed to “harvest” whatever edible plants I grew in pots before I did.

So, I settled on growing ornamental plants. Over the years, I’ve invested in plants that are attractive to bees and hummingbirds. One bush in particular that I planted about seven years ago plays host to a swarm of diligent honeybees who spend their days sipping at the flowers. There’s also a squadron of mighty black carpenter bees, whose loud rumbling buzz makes me think of them as Bee-52s. Many guests have been disturbed to sit next to that bush due to the constant drone of busy bees, but both honeybees and carpenter bees are docile, and no one has ever been stung by sitting near it.

This summer I am shocked and dismayed to note that there’s been a dramatic reduction in my sweet honeybee visitors. I’ve yet to see a single honeybee on the bush that, during previous summers, was swarmed from dawn to dusk. Occasionally I spot a lone black carpenter bee hovering over one of my hydrangeas, but I have not seen any honeybees visiting my garden, save the heartbreaking sight of a disoriented honeybee crawling in circles on the concrete for half an hour before it laid still on the ground. It was mostly likely a victim of collecting pollen from plants that have been treated with neonicotinoid pesticides, which have been shown to disrupt the nervous systems of bees resulting in a staggering collapse of bee populations around the world. For the record, I only buy ornamentals from nurseries that do not sell neonicotinoid treated plants.

If we lose honeybees, the economic cost will run to the trillions of dollars as they pollinate some of our most popular crops such as: apples, almonds, watermelons, strawberries, blueberries, tomatoes, cherries, avocados, onions, pumpkins, and numerous other vegetables. Imagine life without these foods!

But it’s not the economic cost that is bothering me today. It’s the sadness I feel at watching these amazing creatures disappear before my eyes. Each time I see a dead honeybee my soul aches. Each death is a painful reminder that the mass extinction event now underway is much closer to home than I care to admit. Each of these tiny deaths is a sure sign that the way as us-humans currently operate in the world is literally killing nature and, as anyone reading this knows, us-humans are nature. How long until we start to see the signs of human colony collapse? Maybe the signs are already there and we’re ignoring them? There’s an old saying that the dosage makes the poison. How many more billions of tons of toxins can we release into the biosphere before we too are crawling around in circles only to eventually lay still against the Earth?
