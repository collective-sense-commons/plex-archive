## Synchronicity: AI Can Help Bridge the Gap in Climate Action
by **Klaus Mager**

Expanding on the plan to introduce and expand the role of AI in our food system:

[Conversations with AI - The Future of Food](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JpfpAytH1Kt8mas93Q5mEcpCLN0uIG4IllSOz5_o3os/edit?usp=sharing)

While there are valid concerns about the role of AI in our collective future, we should not allow that to paralyze our response to a far more immediate concern: surviving a changing climate by mitigating and adapting to the needs and demands of nature.

I maintain the same story; while our food system as configured today is a main driver of environmental degradation, it also has the capacity to change from contributing 1/3rd of global emissions to going carbon negative. The most significant challenge is to work with a common set of assumptions that coordinates and communicates across the spectrum of the economy a set of targeted outcomes, achieving what I would refer to asÂ [Synchronicity](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/synchronicity-systemic-change-klaus-mager-j13xc/).

AI can fill that gap, provided that the algorithms feeding it are trusted and made widely available. It does sound like a very OGMy kind of thing to do.
