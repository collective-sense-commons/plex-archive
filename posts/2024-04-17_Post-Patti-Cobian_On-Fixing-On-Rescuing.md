## On Fixing, On Rescuing
by **Patti Cobian**

Fixing and rescuing
savior behavior
the sly operator
wears a clumsy mask

I do, I did!
I changed, I fixed!

I owned it and
I made it mine

Welcome to the ego's playground
I'll fix the broken! I'll solve your problem!
There are no other ways here
but mine

A prize to claim
the hero!
finally regarded
with appreciation

Dance in celebration!
But the mask slips,
and now we see beneath
a dark tenderness that lies,
disguised,

beneath the striving,
and the weight
of our grief.

We turn away from those dark
soft, vulnerable centers,
the black holes

born of a need
that hadn't been met,
a frantic filling
of what should have been

in another time
an earlier year

But we hide the need

Ashamed of the need, unaware of the need,
knowing only it's ache and depth
in unguarded moments, brief.

We, the creators of worlds,
destroying our own
with all of the black holes
only visible in the absence
of what has been taken,
taken,
taken

Consumption is the game

isolation, the finishing line

and separation, the song

on the silent lips of every dead body
corpses scattered
a wasteland of death,
when there is no more to extract.

We exert
in the absence of trust,

and side-by-side, do we deny
the invitation that is our birthright:

back into the depths
to know our own tenderness
so that our true nature
can be born

In the soil
of a forgotten garden,
secrets are buried
the seeds of salvation for all

planted in our depths
seeping deeper and deeper into our tissues
forgotten,
until they rise again

malignant growth
organs, revolt

becoming the very fibers
of our deepest questions:

What is our place in the world?
but also
what is our place within ourselves?
These tired bodies burn with a question
that throbs and aches:

*Where do I belong?*

And so it is
in our quest to belong,
we penetrate and we burrow,
deeply,
we extract the life from another
until they are shriveled

so that we might enjoy
a moment of fullness
– fleeting, heart beating –
and in this way, for just a moment

we at least feel sure
about something.
