## Dementia
by **Ken Homer**

**Dementia**

It’s a tragic thing
When the mind
Can no longer hold
The contents of the present
When new memories
Fail to form and
Old ones slowly fade
Like Matthew Brady’s
Silvered Civil War plates
The scenes they recorded
Once so vibrant and real
Left too long in the sun
Slowly becoming outlines
Precious details growing fainter
Until no trace is left
Of the faces and places
That made them meaningful

My dear cousin
Now 84
One of only two people alive
Who knew me
When I was a child
The only living relative
I’m on speaking terms with
Talks in circles
Asks the same questions
Over and over
Where are you?
What are you doing?
When will you visit me?
Are you married?
(She was at my wedding)
Do I know your wife?
Where are you?
Why are you in California?
What made you call me?

I give her my best
Patiently repeating
My answers
Telling her I love her
How much I miss her
All the while
My heart grows
Heavier with each
Repeated question and
Each repeated answer

She complains to me
My children
Sold my apartment
I loved it there
And now it’s gone
But next week
I am going
To get another one
On the Upper East Side
When I do
I will call you
And you can
Come and stay
With me
You’ll do that
Won’t you?
Of course I will

She asks again
Where are you?

I’m here
At least
I think I am
Sometimes it’s hard
To know for sure

## Portrait of a Nature Trail
by **Todd Hoskins**

There’s a small nature conservancy a few miles east of Saugatuck, Michigan, a quaint little town on the shores of Lake Michigan where we lived for seven years. The Wade Memorial Nature Sanctuary is relatively small and infrequently visited since there are more majestic parks with towering sand dunes close by.

At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic I developed the habit of a sunrise hike with the dog, which I continue to this day. Wade was the most frequent destination for two and a half years because it was nearby and quiet, except for when the sandhill cranes were visiting.

I have likely walked that 1.1 mile loop more than 500 times. For a bit, I experimented with trail running there, too. But the trail is not groomed and protruding roots are not good for the ankles nor the gait.

I hiked because the outdoors, in addition to being my heart’s passion, was a refuge during that time. I could activate my senses, get the dog some exercise, and continue my lifelong pursuit of thinking less. Letting the body move and the mind rest.

If the Wade trail was a flavor of ice cream, she would be chocolate chip–dependable but with little frills or thrills. That’s what I thought when I began that oft-daily circle beneath the hemlocks and birches. The dog seemed to want to chase deer every day, and I was hoping to relive the moments of sighting owls, martens, tree frogs, and falcons. Wade rarely delivered a story worthy of telling at the breakfast table.

But as I became more familiar with the bends of the trail, the individual trees, the songs of the birds, and the shifting groundcover, I began to see more. There were more varieties of greens in the spring, and browns in the fall. The columbine appeared for just a short week. One day in the winter, an entire section of the forest was covered in snow fleas. I didn’t know such strange creatures existed.

The west side of the trail provides an overlook to Silver Lake, what I considered the highlight of the hike. But the modest grandiosity of the water became less so over time, and the delights delivered more in seeing how much changes every day. 

I love exploring, whether it’s ideas or experiences or places. In these explorations, I’m often seeking what is new, or novel. Hiking the same trail hundreds of times showed me the surprises in the familiar, the new in the mundane. It was therapy, and it still is.
