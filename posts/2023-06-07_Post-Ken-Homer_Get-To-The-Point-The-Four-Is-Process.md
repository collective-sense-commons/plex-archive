“Just the facts, please.” ~ Joe Friday

Everyone loves a good story, right? Well, usually. However, there are times, especially at work, when stories aren’t the most effective way to communicate. If you are a busy manager and an employee comes to you with a relatively straightforward problem wrapped in a long story detailing the personalities and the history of the everyone involved, your experience of listening to their story is more likely to be one of exasperation than that of rapt attention.

A common question I encounter in my coaching work falls along the lines of, “How do I get people to come to the point without appearing impatient or rude?” It’s a fair question. Most every company has some storytellers in it. When our work brings us into contact with such people, how can we encourage them to be more succinct and get to the point sooner? How can we get them to move from starting with the story and ending with the point – the triangle above on the left – to starting with the point and filling in just the details we need to understand the situation – the triangle on the right?

I suggest a process I call **The Four I’s.** The Four I’s are: Issues, Impacts, Ideas, and Inputs, and they’re not just for storytellers. When adopted as a practice that everyone regularly engages with, the Four I's has the potential to save vast amounts of time in meetings and level up everyone’s communication skills.

Suppose you’re encountering a challenge in your work and you need some support from your colleagues. The Four I’s will help you to be as clear and concise as possible and will instigate laser-focused conversations for generating solutions.

### The Four I’s are: Issues, Impacts, Ideas, and Inputs.

**The first “I” deals with defining the Issue.** Begin by summing up the situation in a single sentence and, if needed, you can include one or maybe two sentences of context. Example:

**Issue: **Lack of motivation on my team. Several people on my team are engaged in boring routine work. That makes it difficult to keep them motivated.

**The second “I” defines the Impacts.** Articulate the main impacts that your issue creates. If the list is long write it out, but only share the top three or, at most, five impacts. You don’t want to overwhelm people. They’ll have a chance to ask for additional information. Example:

**Impacts: **The lack of motivation translates into:

- Poor quality work.
- Low morale.
- Boredom and restlessness.
- Envy toward those whose work is more varied.

**The third “I” is your ideas **– both what you have tried (and how they worked) as well as things you think are worth trying. You want to include these so that the people you are asking for input will know what has and hasn’t been tried so they can be stimulated by your thinking. Example:

**Ideas: **What I have tried:

- Soliciting ideas from my team members – the top item was a pay increase – which I’m unable grant – and the second was working remotely, also a non-starter. Nothing else they offered was feasible.
- Increasing flextime options – tried it but didn’t really make a dent.

What I would like to try:

- Cross-training so that people can learn new skills, but the union will balk.
- Obtaining scholarships for those who would like to attend training programs to diversify their skills.
- Instituting a bonus system for those who exceed production targets.

**The final “I” is about soliciting inputs:** Here is where you make a request to your boss/colleague(s) to become your thinking partner to help you solve the issue. Sample request:

*“Now that I have laid all this out, I would love to get your input. Is everything clear? Do you have any questions? If this was your issue, how would you go about resolving it?”*

**Two helpful tips here:**

1) If you are able to formulate a question or two that, if answered, would help you move forward, include them in your request. Example: *“What would you do to convince the union to see cross-training as a win for the employee, the union, and the company?” *Or, *“Who do you think is the best person in HR for me to speak with about freeing up some money for bonuses?”*

2) Be genuinely open to the input you receive. Before you reject an idea because you don’t think it will fly, thank the person who offered it and ask them how they would implement it given the constraints you are operating under. They may have a perspective you hadn’t considered before that just might move you closer to resolving your issue.

It does take time to sketch all this out and we all know time is the one thing we don’t have enough of. However, the time you spend on the front end will be more than made up for by the productivity of the conversations that result. With practice, you’ll become adept at analyzing, synthesizing, and summarizing. You’ll find your conversations are more satisfying and productive. Give it a try and let me know how it works for you.
