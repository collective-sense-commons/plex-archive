Background:

***Good Enough Ancestor*** is officially out now, and we invite you to celebrate with us all month long!

Learn the story of Audrey Tang, as she reflects on democracy in Taiwan and around the globe.

Filmed over ten days in the lead-up to Taiwan’s historic 2024 elections, the poetic documentary threads together Tang’s reflections on her own life—overcoming bullying, a life-threatening heart condition, and gender dysphoria—with the story of Taiwan’s evolution from martial law to its most recent election.

Against the backdrop of rising authoritarianism and geopolitical tensions, ***Good Enough Ancestor*** is a timely reminder of the fragility of democracy and the responsibility to tend to it for future generations.
