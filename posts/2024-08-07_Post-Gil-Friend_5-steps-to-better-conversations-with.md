## 5 steps to better conversations with your GPT—and your colleagues

What are the five things wrong with this request? “I need that report tomorrow.”

You tell me. Then I’ll tell you.

You may think you know how to get the best out of an AI, because after all you’ve been making requests of people your whole life. But actually, you’re probably incompetent in both realms – getting disappointing or less than ideal responses from your AIs, and missing opportunities for great results—and great relationships—with the people you work with, and the people you love. If you’ll just be mindful of a few simple elements – and practice them so they become second nature – you’ll find that you consistently get massively better results. In both realms.

People get weird about AIs in various ways, but part of the mess is us.

I remember the early days of desktop publishing—just because you *could* format your own publications  didn’t mean you would do it well. And many people are still lame with something as basic as search. I have colleagues who complain that they can’t get what they want from Google—or from ChatGPT—when just adding or moving a word or two produces a cascade of value.

But the problem is more basic, deeper, more important. Because we often treat people as ineptly.

Think about the requests you make—of colleagues as well as of bots. How many cycles does it take to get a request—and a result—right between two people?

Requests are one of five [performative verbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performative_verb)—words that actually **create** something, rather than merely describe something. “Will you join me for a 30 minute meeting in the conference room at 2:45pm Tuesday to finalize our decision about…” is not just more detail than “we met Tuesday and made a decision about…” It’s a completely different linguistic act. It creates a possibility. It invites a promise. (Another of the five.) **And it provides a template for a competent request.**

We take this for granted in part because we’ve trained our software tools to handle this for us (our calendaring software, though unfortunately not our communications software), and in part because we assume that what’s obvious to us is also obvious to the other party.

But it’s worth some attention and care.

We conducted a valuable experiment at [Natural Logic](https://pages.natlogic.com/home) (my strategy company) decades ago. We were growing fast. We were learning and failing about communicating with each other, coordinating, delivering quality work at speed. And things weren’t working.

So we instituted a process for making and accepting requests of each other (building on the work of Fernando Flores, Robert Dunham, Chauncey Bell, and others).

We established a simple rule: “If a request is incomplete, you are free to decline it—even if it comes from a superior.” The result (after some stumbling and awkwardness): competent requests that were more likely to get both parties what they want—and build team trust and effectiveness.

Imagine saying to a staff member, “I need you to go research diversity in the tech industry.” They come back with beautifully distilled two page report and I say, no, “I really needed something longer, more detailed, and fully referenced.” Or vice versa. They didn’t know—because I didn’t tell them! Is this to help me prepare for a speech? a board meeting? or a proposal?

So what must a competent request include, to be considered, accepted and fulfilled? Five key elements:

- **What** is being requested—e.g., conversation, document, product, action, etc.;
- **By when**—specific deadline or timeframe;
- **For whom**—who will be impacted by the outcome;
- **For the sake of what**—the purpose, reason, or context of the request; why it request matters;
- **With what conditions of satisfaction**—e.g., outcomes; precision; proof; form/dimensions/style; etc.

You may think that all this is obvious, that you know how to do this, that you do it all the time. It isn’t. And—trust me—you don’t.

Here’s one way you can tell: Shallow or unfulfilled promises—another of the performative verbs—may disclose incomplete requests. Or lack of trust. Or a difference in the moods of the requester and the promisor. (We’ll explore trust and mood another time.)

Here’s an example:

Can you get this to me next week? Sure. Hey, it’s Tuesday, where is it? I thought you meant by the end of the week. No I meant Monday. OK, I’ll get ot to you by Monday next week.Hey, it’s Monday, where is it? I thought you meant by the end of the day. No I meant Monday first thing. OK, I’ll get it to you by Monday next week.And is “first thing” 9am? or 7am? It depends, doesn’t it.

It really matters for the person receiving the request. it’s actually undercutting them to not make the request complete. (Hint: Meet an incomplete request with a few simple questions to clarify the conditions of satisfaction and the “for the sake of what.”

And so it is with AI. You’ll get better results with competent prompts. Prompts that include—as with humans—each of these elements. (Except “by when,” since since the assumption and the code is always “right now.”)

With an AI, you can either specify these conditions with each prompt, or customize your GPT by setting “global instructions” that will apply for all your prompts. You’ve done that, right? (You may still want to add specific instructions for specific prompts, but getting your global instructions right will make you—and your team—much happier and more productive.)

It doesn’t necessarily have to be this formulaic and structured with a human, because we share what Dunham calls a “background of obviousness”—a shared context formed in a relationship or an organizational culture (which is of course a network of relationships—and conversations). But it’s learned through practice over time, much like a musician learns musical scales as a shared language that enables an orchestra to play together or a jazz combo to riff, or like a baby learns to function in a world.

So don’t assume that the background of obviousness is obvious. Sometimes it doesn’t need to be spoken, but sometimes it does.

So tell me:

- Was what I’ve written about here obvious to you?
- Is making competent requests a consistent practice in your communications, and your organization?
- What’s been provoked in you by this reading?
- What actions will you take to improve your request competence, with both people and AIs?

**PS:** Here’s my Five Minute University [introduction to language action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxjcXgxW4vA)—and the three other performative verbs that will change the way you communicate. Guaranteed.
