## Synchronicity in Systemic Change
by **Klaus Mager**

A nugget from the upcoming NeoBook Volume II, [**Food and Agriculture: Leading From The Future As It Emerges**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CmJQTe7EbwxmwXmVzZAEuSyQ6wUCqs-JRECvMxV9kRY/edit?usp=sharing)**.**

### Synchronicity
In the realm of systemic transformations, the concept of synchronicity is a fascinating concept introduced by the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung to describe the meaningful coincidence of events such as similar thoughts in widely separated persons or a mental image of an unexpected event before it happens. To put it simply, synchronicity happens when a coincidence is so striking and unexpected that it seems to have a deeper significance. Jung believed that synchronicity revealed something fundamental about the nature of reality. He saw it as evidence of a deep interconnectedness of the universe, and a bridging of our inner and outer worlds. His idea was that, in certain rare moments, the barrier between our conscious, rational mind and the mysterious, unseen forces of the universe thins, allowing for these meaningful coincidences to occur.

 It provides a unique lens to view large-scale change. This essay examines the necessity of regulatory intervention and communication between all market participants in steering structural transformations, particularly in sectors like transportation and food, where market forces alone have proven insufficient in addressing broader socioeconomic and environmental considerations.

### The Transportation Sector: A Case Study in Asynchronous Change
The promotion and incentivization of electric vehicles represent a significant step towards a more sustainable transportation future. However, this transition has highlighted a critical challenge: the lack of coordinated planning and infrastructure development. Electric cars require a supportive ecosystem – charging stations, specialized mechanics, and appropriate repair shops. The current system, primarily designed for gasoline vehicles, illustrates a lack of synchronicity in change management. Gas station owners, automotive repair shops, and the associated workforce feeling neglected and potentially threatened by this shift, may become inadvertent opponents, slowing the transition.

### The Food System: A Similar Story
In parallel, the food system is also undergoing a vital shift towards sustainable practices. However, this transition faces similar challenges as the unregulated / unguided market tends to overlook crucial factors not just related to workforce training, employment shifts, and environmental impacts, but also the socioeconomic and cultural consequences of changing the most basic of needs: access to food that is familiar, affordable, healthy. 

The tendency to operate in silos can be a significant barrier. Individual stakeholders – manufacturers, consumers, farmers, technology providers, retailers, and policymakers – often work towards their specific goals without a shared roadmap. This lack of an organized communication structure leads to sub-optimization, where the actions of one group may inadvertently undermine or conflict with those of another.

Traditional market mechanisms focus primarily on economic efficiencies and short-term gains, often neglecting the need for a comprehensive approach that includes workforce adaptation to new agricultural methods, the environmental impact of production practices, and the dietary and cultural adaptations required by the public.

History shows that markets do not naturally adapt to include broader socioeconomic and environmental factors unless there are external incentives. Without regulatory intervention as in farm bill reform, essential aspects of the food system transformation – such as soil regeneration, biodiversity conservation, and equitable distribution of resources – may remain unaddressed.

### The Role of Regulation and Communication
Strategic regulatory interventions and organized private sector communication frameworks are critical in bridging these silos. Regulation as in farm bill reform can provide a unified direction, ensuring that all stakeholders are aligned towards common goals – be it the development of EV infrastructure or the adoption of regenerative agricultural practices.

Establishing channels for open dialogue and information exchange is crucial. This can involve cross-sectoral collaborations, public-private partnerships, and platforms for sharing best practices and innovations.

Beyond providing direction, regulations can also incentivize actions that are beneficial for the system as a whole. This could mean subsidies and/or tax incentives for sustainable farming practices.

### Conclusion
The shift towards a sustainable future in any sector requires breaking down the silos of isolated effort. An unregulated or misaligned market, left to its own devices, tends to optimize individual components rather than the system as a whole. Integrating strategic regulation with a strong communication infrastructure can ensure that the transformation is both synchronized and systemic, aligning individual efforts towards a collective goal. This integrative approach is vital in steering our societal systems towards a sustainable and cohesive future.
