## “Office Hours”
by **Stacey Druss** and **Peter Kaminski**

Ever wanted to talk with somebody, but “didn't want to bother them?”

Into that space, and inspired by Jerry's idea to have “office hours” (see **Rel8** just above), Stacey and Pete are starting an informal experiment to have office hours, too.

- Jerry: various days/times, see [Jerry's Office Hours - Rel8 Wiki](https://wiki.rel8.dev/jerry)
- Pete: Tuesdays, 10pm UTC (3pm PDT, 6pm EDT)
- Stacey: Mondays, 11am EDT

Hey, do you want to set up office hours, too?
