## Evolving Connected Human Intelligence (with AI?)
by **Michael Lennon**

### Online Event, June 25
*At the [Complexity Adventures June Basecamp](https://coda.io/d/Complexity-Adventures-Atlas_dF3QBOZlR4p/Monthly-Basecamps_suBLu) this Sunday, June 25, 4-7pm EDT*

For all who attended the April unconference of **Complexity Adventures** *(and friends from Plex, Prosocial.World, Earth Regenerators, Deep Transformation Network, For the Good of All NOW!, the Active Inference institute, and the Presencing Institute),* we are resuming our conversations and proto-ventures this weekend at the upcoming monthly basecamp meeting.

Join us for the on-going conversation: [https://coda.io/d/Complexity-Adventures-Atlas_dF3QBOZlR4p/Monthly-Basecamps_suBLu](https://coda.io/d/Complexity-Adventures-Atlas_dF3QBOZlR4p/Monthly-Basecamps_suBLu)

More about the session:

Clusters of neurons grow into collectively smarter networks (“self-assembling brains”) which in turn can become meta-networks of connected wisdom.

Can principles for neurons evolving into smarter “connected learning clusters”–and fractally into meta-smarter networks of clusters–extend from human brains to human groups and larger collectives? Might neighborhoods, networks, or cities extend connected learning capacity to better co-regulate collective care of bioregions, watersheds, and planetary commons?

In this session, we will explore intriguing ideas and principles from information science and neurobiology for building self-assembling connected intelligence. We will also aim to identify promising opportunities for “extending the collective learning edges of our own self-organizing intelligence” (a.k.a “connected consciousness”).
