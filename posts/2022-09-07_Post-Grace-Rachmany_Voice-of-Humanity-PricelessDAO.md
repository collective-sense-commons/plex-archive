## Voice of Humanity / PricelessDAO
by **Grace Rachmany**

The **PricelessDAO** whitepaper draft is available for anyone who would like to read and comment before we publish it on the [pricelessdao.io](http://pricelessdao.io/) website.

Our regular weekly meeting will resume this week at 7 pm Central European Time. Zoom link: [https://us02web.zoom.us/j/85805066728?pwd=bHpkTnlrV2pKOXlsV3VEZ0ZCOVdsUT09](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://us02web.zoom.us/j/85805066728?pwd%3DbHpkTnlrV2pKOXlsV3VEZ0ZCOVdsUT09&sa=D&source=calendar&ust=1662822173785690&usg=AOvVaw1M_2HSiwpkBGVVlLXIDkUh) 

There will be six meetings about the marketing and fundraising for PricelessDAO, on a weekly basis, skipping the week of October 4. Calls are open to anyone who would like to join and help.

We also encourage anyone interested to join our [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/yR6HcmWjGC ) and follow us on Twitter to help us make it lively and make us look like a real thing: [@PricelessEcon](https://twitter.com/PricelessEcon).

This week we took a break for the [Crypto Commons Association](https://www.crypto-commons.org/) annual gathering in Austria, which brought together a few dozen projects including [Token Engineering Commons](https://tecommons.org/), [Regen Network](https://www.regen.network/), [Mattereum](https://mattereum.com/), [BlockScience](https://block.science/), [Breadchain](https://breadcha.in/), [LaborDAO](https://www.thelabordao.com/), [SanghaDAO](https://sanghadao.garden/), and [Holochain](https://www.holochain.org/) for work and fun!
