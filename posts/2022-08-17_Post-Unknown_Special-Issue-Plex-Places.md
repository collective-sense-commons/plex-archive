# Special Issue Plex Places

**Author:** [[Unknown]]
**Issue:** [2022-08-17](https://plex.collectivesensecommons.org/2022-08-17/)

## Special Issue: Plex Places
Biweekly Plex Dispatch usually covers **what** is going on in the Plex.

This issue of the BPD looks at the Plex a little differentlyâ€“**where** is the Plex? Where do we congregate and converse? Let's take a little tour.

We won't necessarily find *all* the places that are part of the Plex today, but later this year, watch this space to see what's changed, and what's new. Please let us know if there are places *you* consider part of the Plex, that we haven't addressed here, so we can report on it next time. Thank you!
