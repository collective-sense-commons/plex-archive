## U.S. 395
by **Peter Kaminski**

[U.S. Route 395](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_395_in_California) runs through the US West from the Canadian border to the Southern California desert. From Reno/Carson City driving south, it runs through the Eastern Sierra Nevada mountains. Itâ€™s beautifully scenic; here are a few photos taken along the highway.
