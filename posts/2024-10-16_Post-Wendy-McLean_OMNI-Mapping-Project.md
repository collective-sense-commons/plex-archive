## OMNI-Mapping Project
by **Wendy McLean & Vincent Arena**

Wendy McLean & Vincent Arena announce a new joint effort, **OMNI-Mapping Project,** fiscally sponsored by the Buckminster Fuller Institute.  A map is a visual representation of information intended to provide clarity and simplicity. Every organization engages in mapping, but most don’t create maps with enough intentional design to provide insights, drive understanding, and inform action. Additionally, organizations waste significant resources creating maps from scratch that cannot be reused or shared. OMNI-Mapping solves this by building powerful processes that make maps more useful in their local contexts, and available globally.

Our mission is to advance the field of mapping by standardizing data collaboration across silos and equipping organizations with a 3-step process designed to:

- assess their information landscape, 
- understand the data with greater clarity and perspective, and 
- act with confidence, now and in the future

OMNI-Mapping enables small to medium-size non-profit organizations and communities to more effectively achieve their unique goals. Because OMNI-Maps integrate existing data across networks, using the OMNI-Mapping framework unlocks the full potential of any organizations’ existing efforts to enable systemic impact. For example, OMNI-Mapping offers leaders of non-profit organizations access to public data from other people and organizations with similar projects, so they can share solutions and resources in pursuit of their own initiatives. OMNI-Maps empower coordination to better meet challenges across organizations, platforms, and bioregions.

The OMNI-Mapping Project will deliver a robust infrastructure and process, designed to elevate capabilities for any organization, through:

 • interconnected global datasets for seamless integration across existing maps; 
 • a proven framework and toolkit for implementing better map building processes; and
 • local mapping templates for creating maps that quickly integrate data from popular tools like Airtable, Kumu, and Catalist.

By adopting OMNI-Mapping, you’re not just creating better maps -- you’re joining a community of mapmakers, leaders and users who are getting more out of their data with less effort. 

We are currently seeking pilot partners and systemic financing. If you have questions or are interested in contributing to the OMNI-Mapping project, visit [omnimapping.org](https://omnimapping.org/) or contact either of the project’s co-leads: [vincent@omnimapping.org](mailto:vincent@omnimapping.org)  or [wendy@omnimapping.org](mailto:wendy@omnimapping.org). Thank you!
