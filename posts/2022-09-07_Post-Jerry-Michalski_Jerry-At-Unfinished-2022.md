## Jerry At Unfinished 2022
**Jerry Michalski** will be speaking and Braining at [Unfinished 2022](https://unfinished.ro/) in Bucharest in early October. (There's another Unfinished, in the US, which [sort of poached the name](https://theconnector.substack.com/p/the-unfinished-work-of-frank-mccourt).) He gave [this keynote](https://youtu.be/gf3vp0Wquz8) about trust virtually in 2020, and [StoryThreaded](https://bra.in/5jXKe2) six sessions at the 2021 event. 

Attendance is free, but Unfinished would like participants to invest a bit of their time. You can apply to attend [here](https://auth.unfinished.ro/apply). He would **love** to be collaborating with OGMers while he's there.
