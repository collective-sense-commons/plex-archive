## 40 Terabytes and a Mule
by **Michael Grossman** and **Jerry Michalski**

On Thursday, March 9th at 8am Pacific, 11am Eastern, we invite you to join our OGM topic call on “[40 Terabytes and a Mule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-CHHAO5LPw&t=4346s)” (link goes to Michael's description on YouTube, from the **2023-02-23 OGM Call**).

We will explore a thought-provoking concept: what if each of us had our own “digital home” that contained all the information that has been collected about us—everything we believe to be true, for ourselves? What if *we* could manage this information and choose to share it how we wanted to, with only the other people and groups that we wanted to connect with?

Perhaps our true selves could be represented with more fidelity. Rather than the non-consensual data that is currently collected about us, which only shows what we are seduced by, perhaps we could know and share what we genuinely care about and who we genuinely are.
