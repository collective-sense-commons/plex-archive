## Nature: Love Her Back to Health
by **Klaus Mager**

Recent files that have been shared in the OGM and other networks are creating a story we should add to our libraries, embed deeply into our consciousness.

There is a theme emerging that recognizes that food and agriculture must be elevated to the same level of attention as the energy sector, in fact should be prioritized to secure our very survival, through mitigation and adaptation. 

That is so very encouraging, but requires the same level of transformative change the energy sector so far has been incapable to achieve. How can we accelerate global consciousness to embrace nature with love, joy, and open hearts?

Looking at all of this, what comes to mind is “Common Sense”. We all know and understand nature on an intuitive level, and want to love her back to health.
