## Global Regeneration CoLab
The [Global Regeneration CoLab](https://www.grc.earth/) (GRC) foments peer-to-peer support for regeneration changemakers in many sectors around the world. Lots of small zoom discussions (synchronous) and an active slack instance (asynchronous) enable knowledge flow, partnering, problem solving, and motivational enhancement! Contact David Witzel ([dwitzel@policycommons.org](mailto:dwitzel@policycommons.org)) if youâ€™d like to join or learn more. Great folks, great organization!
