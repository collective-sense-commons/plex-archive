## Plex Reflection Questions
by **Peter Kaminski**

I created these questions as starters for Plex conversations, and I realized they might be good reflection questions for Plex readers, as well. Please use or repurpose them as you wish. Send me an email, kaminski@istori.com, if you happen to end up with something written to share!

**Your Story / Our Story**

1. Tell me an anecdote from your life, either recent or from the past.
2. Tell me a memory or story about the Plex, OGM, CICOLAB, etc.

**Your Project(s)**

1. What project are you currently most excited about, and why?
2. Are there any collaborations or partnerships you can tell us about that are playing a key role in your current work?
3. How do you see your current projects evolving over the rest of the year?
4. Are there any emerging trends that are influencing your work right now?
5. What would you most like Plex readers to know about your project?

**Current Events**

1. What do you think are the most pressing global issues we're facing today?
2. What do you think is required for people to focus their attention on those issue?
3. Will we succeed in addressing them, or will we fail?
4. How do you think recent advances in AI will impact society in the near future?
5. What challenge would you most like to focus Plex readers on?
