## 5-Minute University
by **Jerry Michalski** and **Peter Kaminski**

In the July 6th OGM Thursday call, we had a great first set of 5-Minute Universities:

- [AI/ML: History and Prospects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEOBMQkyYD0&t=545s) (Jerry Michalski)
- [Essential Elements of Agreements](https://youtu.be/cEOBMQkyYD0?t=1273) (Stewart Levine)
- [Words & Worlds](https://youtu.be/cEOBMQkyYD0?t=1986) (Gil Friend)
- [Gardenworld Politics](https://youtu.be/cEOBMQkyYD0?t=2661) (Douglass Carmichael)

We enjoyed each of them, and having them together, and we will be adding 5minU to our formats for future OGM calls. Please consider sharing something you care about as a 5-Minute University. [Email Jerry](mailto:sociate@gmail.com) to get on the list to present.

You'll find details on how to do 5minU [here](https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/5-minute_universities). Those instructions were written for recording and posting 5minUs; adapt as appropriate for live presentation.
