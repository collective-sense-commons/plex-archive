## Planetary CARE Quick Takes
by **Forrist Lytehaause**

We have a few people going through both [WINfinity](https://www.winfinityframework.com/inquiry-clusters) and [ImpactLaunch's Radical Transformational Leadership](https://www.impactlaunch.org/services) training. We've found both to be very valuable.

**Marianne Wyne** and I presented as part of Global Unity's [Transformative
Impact Summit](https://www.transformativeimpactsummit.com/) last weekendâ€“amazing line up of people.

You can find out more about Planetary CARE on our website: [https://planetarycare.org/](https://planetarycare.org/about-2/).
