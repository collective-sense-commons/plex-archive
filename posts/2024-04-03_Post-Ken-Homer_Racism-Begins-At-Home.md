## Racism Begins At Home
by **Ken Homer**

The racism in my house growing up
Was not particularly overt
But it was definitely there
Although my father pretty much
Eschewed religion–Don’t fall for that
Jesus crap–he believed that Black
People bore the mark of Cain

I suspect that was a lesson learned
In his early childhood something he
Absorbed before he was capable
Of critically examining what his elders
Were teaching him about the world
Just as I was incapable of questioning
The racism he passed along to me
I simply adopted his views as my own

The only Black person I was exposed to
As a young child was my aunt and
Uncle’s housekeeper – Daisy
Who was always kind to me
Daisy made the most amazing
Chocolate chip cookies
Served warm from the oven
With a large glass of milk
I liked Daisy a lot
She had a great laugh
And she knew how to talk to children

I couldn’t figure out how to
Reconcile my father’s view of Black
People with my experience of Daisy
When I tried to talk with him about it
He would tell me that you could
Sometimes find individual Black people
Who were okay but as a race
Black people were not to be trusted

I internalized my dad’s fear of Black
People at a very early age
Whenever we’d go into New York City
I would worry that the car would break
Down in a Black neighborhood and
We’d be exposed to horrible dangers

My dad would toss out The N-word
Now and then as the Civil Rights
Movement was gaining momentum
Nearly always conjoined with Goddamn
I knew it was a word of rare power
I could sense the hatred it transmitted
The absolute disgust that it conveyed

My dad’s racism came to the fore
Whenever race riots erupted
Which happened a lot in the ‘60s
He was incensed when Tommie Smith
And John Carlos raised their fists in the
Black Power Salute in the ‘68 Olympics

He taught me to shoot when I was 7
Just in case “they” came for us
He even bought me my own rifle
(I soon became an expert marksman)
Shooting bottles was one thing
But shooting a human being
Was something else entirely
I’m grateful I was never
Tested in that regard

My father was the manager
Of a department store
He hired several Black people
And he treated them well
He never showed overt signs of racism
He laughed and joked with them
He promoted them when
They proved competent

A flawed and deeply wounded man
My father passed along to me
Many of the conflicting lessons he
Had inherited from his parents and from
The times and culture in which he lived
The impacts of his racism have mostly
Faded from my life but they’re still
Not completely eradicated
I don’t know that they ever will be
