## Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems
by **David Witzel**

*[ed. note: Dave did an amazing job this year of shepherding a group of organizations within the greater Plex to collaboratively develop and submit applications for a US National Science Foundation (NSF) grant for Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE). Here's an update. Ping [Pete](mailto:kaminski@istori.com) if you've got more questions for Dave.]*

The proposals for the NSF POSE grant went in on September 7 and our group submitted several including:

-  [Hylo](https://www.hylo.com/)
- [Terraso](https://terraso.org/)
- [Active Inference](https://www.activeinference.org/)
- [Wildfire resilience scorecard](https://www.preventionweb.net/publication/wildfire-resilience-scorecard)
- [Marine Permaculture Alliance](https://www.climatefoundation.org/marine-permaculture.html)
- and [Wild Me](https://www.wildme.org/)

The intent is to create a core of open source investment and focus so that our regenerative future is not captured by extractive forces.

Weâ€™ll keep the group going for next year too.

From the [NSF grant solicitation](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2023/nsf23556/nsf23556.htm):

The Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) program aims to harness the power of open-source development for the creation of new technology solutions to problems of national and societal importance. [...] The overarching vision of POSE is that proactive and intentional formation of [open source ecosystem (OSE)] managing organizations will ensure a broader and more diverse adoption of open-source products; increased coordination of external intellectual content developer contributions; and a more focused route to technologies with broad societal impact. Toward this end, the POSE program supports the formation of new OSE managing organizations [...].
