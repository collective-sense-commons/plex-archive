### Peter Kaminski
[YouBots.ai](https://youbots.ai/) is now live, in paid beta. I’m the technical co-founder, and it’s a full-time gig for me. YouBots is a curated set of business-savvy chatbots that know more about your business than the typical chatbot. We’re best for small businesses of 5-25 employees who know they need to start using AI, but haven’t had time to figure out how. [Let me know](mailto:kaminski@istori.com) if you have any questions!
