## Announcing MarkPub 0.4.3
by **Peter Kaminski**

**Bill Anderson** and I are pleased to announce [MarkPub](https://markpub.org/)**,** a nice Markdown-based [static site generator](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/14/what-is-a-static-site-generator-and-3-ways-to-find-the-best-one/). It transforms folders of Markdown files (including sub-folders and optional links between files) into websites that you can easily publish to the web for free. Markdown files are easy to edit and arrange, so this turns out to be a great way to build text- and link-heavy websites, without any HTML knowledge.

MarkPub evolves from Massive Wiki Builder, which a number of OGM folks have been using to publish their Obsidian vaults as Massive Wikis. Two key additions have been made: MarkPub is now packaged as a Python module, for seamless upgrades, and it features a new theme with much better sidebar / navigation support.

This is a soft launch of MarkPub at version 0.4.3. As we finalize the theme, documentation, and remaining details, we plan to release version 1.x.x in January.

If youâ€™d like to know more, get in touch with Bill or me, or pop into Massive Wiki Wednesday, every Wednesday at 12:30 PT / 3:30 ET on [zoom/84876942036](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/84876942036?pwd=amVrWVBmRW45RDBoTGE0bmFIQzFKUT09). Or drop by [~massive-wiki on CSC Mattermost](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/massive-wiki).
