## Weaving the Regeneration Web - Two Strands
by **David Witzel**

To realize a regenerative future weâ€™re going to need a strong web inter-connecting the regenerative community. It might happen by accident, but we can also lean-in to help weave this web. Two weaving initiatives with [Global Regeneration CoLab](http://www.grc.earth/) support are:

- In-person - [**Unconference: Exploring Regeneration in the Bay Area with Insights from Jem Bendell**](https://events.humanitix.com/unconference-exploring-regeneration-in-the-bay-area-with-insights-from-jem-bendell) October 19 in Oakland, CA.

We're working to reinforce local SF Bay/Delta bioregional connections and bring together the many people in the area working on regeneration-y projects. The format will be open space, following a provocation talk, to encourage building relationships. *We need your help - please share this announcement with your lists & colleagues!*

- Online - a shared calendar of [**Regeneration Events Happening Around the World**](https://www.grc.earth/regencalendar)**.** The calendar is intended to aggregate events across organizations and projects to make it easier for people to find each other. The calendar is a simple google calendar that can be updated by members of a google group. It is intended to be embedded and re-shared by other like-minded people and organizations. Go ahead - add it to your calendar or embed it in your website! And [add your regeneration-related events](https://www.grc.earth/addevent).
