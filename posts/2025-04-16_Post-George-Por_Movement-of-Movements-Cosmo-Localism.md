## Movement of Movements, Cosmo-Localism, and AI
by **George Pór**

*George is preparing an article to be submitted to *[*ephemera*](https://ephemerajournal.org/)*, and graciously offered to share his prep notes as his article is coming together:*

*I directed Gemini Advanced 2.5 Pro (experimental) to write an intro to flow from Plex to George's notes, so you'd have an idea of their richness. Here it is below. Gemini wrote the following content, but I have carefully reviewed it and I take responsibility for publishing it. –Pete*

Imagine vibrant local movements springing up worldwide, each tackling unique challenges–but how could they unite into something bigger, a global “Movement of Movements,” without losing their grassroots energy? George’s notes dive into this puzzle, exploring the delicate political dance required. It’s a balancing act between letting things grow organically (emergence) and providing just enough structure to work together effectively (design). Could new technologies, perhaps even AI, help navigate this complex choreography and allow movements to build the future they envision, right here and now?

On the economic front, the notes sketch out a compelling alternative called “cosmo-localism.” Picture a world where communities freely share knowledge and designs globally (the “cosmo” part) but produce goods and solutions locally, tailored to their specific needs and environments. This isn’t just about making things differently; it’s about valuing things differently, considering social well-being and ecological health as vital “entangled assets,” aiming to build collaborative networks that can genuinely challenge the logic of traditional capitalism.

So, where does technology fit into this vision? AI is considered not just a futuristic concept but a potential tool for right now–a “coordination engine.” It could help manage the flow of information in the political dance, spotting patterns and connections across diverse groups. Economically, it might assist in matching local needs with shared global knowledge, helping manage resources within these proposed cosmo-local networks. The notes even include a practical example: an AI-generated “pattern card” designed to help activists grapple with the emergence-versus-design tension.

Ultimately, these draft notes offer a fascinating glimpse into building a different kind of future. They grapple with the big questions of how local actions can scale globally, how technology can serve collaboration rather than control, and how movements can build interconnected, resilient systems. It’s a work-in-progress exploring a hopeful pathway where diverse groups learn, share, and coordinate to shape a more just and sustainable world from the ground up.
