## Black Mountain Doughnut Economics
by **Kevin Jones**

We have decided to try a stealth strategy with our **Doughnut Economics** initiative, at least as one tactic. Fifty acres have been gifted to the town of **Black Mountain** for recreation. We are joining with people who want to start with environmental education; trails with the stories of the ecosystem, the archaeology, anthropology, history, etc and add in an economic dimension; some mention of true cost economics (including the externalities).

I may try to resurrect my kids-led biocultural diversity bond under the umbrella of our watershed fund; a simple place to invest in the next 50 years that we want for that place and the places it is connected to. We are going to start by interviewing the leaders to find out more about their goals. They are wise old women, and led an open space imagining of the 50 acres that was attended by close to 40 people.

We gravitated to the environmental education piece. We are working with one college already, and the enviro educator from a tiny college in Black Mountain was also there and I am going to interview her first. Others who know the crones in charge are going to start interviewing them.
