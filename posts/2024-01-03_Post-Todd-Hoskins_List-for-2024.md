## List for 2024
by **Todd Hoskins**

Though I don’t do New Year’s resolutions any more, I do love the turn of the calendar for looking back and looking forward.* *In the gentle spirit of anti-resoluting, I have created a list for 2024:

### Words I Hope to Hear and See Less
**Stakeholder**: name one person who wants to awkwardly hold a stake in their hand
**Changemaker**: who exactly is making the change, and who wants it?
**Elon**: I exempt the university
**Dialectical**: a little less language of opposition would be nice
**Purpose-driven**: I’m all for purpose, but do we need to “drive” it somewhere?

### Curiosities I Intend to Pursue
**HIIT**: I’m not sure I can see myself bouncing around, but I am willing to try
**Eye yoga**: okay, maybe “optical strength exercises” is more appealing?
**Spanish dubbing with English subtitles**: escuchar y aprender?
**Video-making**: resistance has given way to curiosity
**Collaborative writing**: more on that in coming months

### What I Want Less of
**Warrior wasps**: feels like I’m constantly five feet away from two hours of pain
**Wilting vegetables in the fridge drawer**: that little pain after what could have been
**Complaining**: applies to me as well
**Repetitious political conversations**: see above
**Victimizing, Vilifying, Heroizing**: triangle of tantalizing absolutes

### What I Want More of
**Laughter**: levity please and a great reason to have a dog
**Writing Time**: no excuses
**Perfectly ripe mangoes**: and the way the knife feels slicing through!
**Unstructured community time**: love with no agenda 
**Un-self-consciousness**: being without worrying how I am being perceived
