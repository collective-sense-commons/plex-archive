## Massive Wiki Builder v2.0
by **Bill Anderson** and **Peter Kaminski**

[Massive Wiki Builder](https://github.com/peterkaminski/massivewikibuilder) is code that publishes the [Massive Wiki](https://massive.wiki/) on your computer to the web, as a (read-only) website.

Energized by the progress being made by [Lionsberg Wiki](https://lionsberg.wiki/), [Rel8 Wiki](https://wiki.rel8.dev/), and others, we have been making great progress on MWB, and will release v2.0 this week.

New features will include:

- Full-text search *with no server-side code needed* (static site hosting friendly!)
- Better support for static assets (images, CSS, JavaScript), including support for favicons in the root directory
- Custom colors on the Alto and Basso themes
- Strikethrough formatting
