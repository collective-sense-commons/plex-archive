## Cycles of Co-Creation, Scaling Collaboration, the Co-creative Cycle, Tapestry, Seriously App
by Wendy McLean

**[Video](https://youtu.be/zew3QNFkTo8) of my Emergent Conversation on the Cycles of Co-Creation - **Much of the work we all do in the Liminal Web spaces is enabled by our ability to have emergent conversations.  I had the honor and joy this past week of being a part of one such wisdom-filled discussion, and with someone whom I’ve only recently met, Killu Sanborn.  About 20 minutes into our time together, we sensed that something insightful, beautiful and possibly also incredibly relevant was coming through.  So, then we agreed to share it.  Here’s some of what was discussed:

- Creating a collaborative vibe - the way a conversation feels - comes from the way we choose to be together, and speaking ‘from’ instead of speaking ‘about’.
- Creating contagious spaces through emerging leadership and emergent conversations.
- The importance of recognizing cycles and establishing feedback loops to best meet and respond to the challenges we face.
- How we might better recognize negative patterns and react to community needs, earlier in the cycle, before a crisis hits.
- Asking new types of questions in evaluating projects, based on their ability to hold space for what’s emerging, to magnify the potential for solving community concerns, or to create efficiencies anywhere along the co-creative cycle.

So here is the [resulting hour-long video](https://youtu.be/zew3QNFkTo8).  Killu and I are still absorbing the gifts of what was shared and how they might apply to the Meta Project (which was what connected us), but I’m open to discussing how this conversation applies to any and all of our OGM communities.  Please reach out to me with comments and ideas at [wendy@everyoneswisdom.com](mailto:wendy@everyoneswisdom.com).

**Mapping out best practices for [Creating Culture](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOCA-BeI=/?invite_link_id=256278948141) and successfully scaling Collaboration.**  My work within the Meta Project, Trove, OGM, Flotilla and WINfinity have all echoed the need to better understand how we can create an environment which builds connections and allows for successful collaboration of decentralized communities at scale.  As a first pass at understanding what’s possible, I created a Miro board with 6 diagrams and began to ask what seemed to me to be the most pressing questions.  If you’re curious, want to provide feedback, want to contribute to the growing list of source materials repository or want to contribute to this work, you can [view the Miro here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOCA-BeI=/?invite_link_id=256278948141) and/or reach out to me at [wendy@everyoneswisdom.com](mailto:wendy@everyoneswisdom.com).

**Emerging Wisdom: Mapping the Co-creative Cycle **- as a result of my conversation with Killu noted above, I’ve embarked on a project to synthesize the many innovation and creativity cycles into one conceptual framework.  My intention is to bring greater awareness, resources and support for every stage of a projects’ evolution, so that we can choose to speed up the process in order to better meet the challenges of our time.  If you have a favorite framework or model, I’d love to hear about it as part of my research.  Please reach out to me at [wendy@everyoneswisdom.com](mailto:wendy@everyoneswisdom.com).  Thank you! 

**Tapestry Update** - Phase 1 of the Tapestry prototype was completed on schedule, and quickly highlighted the need for a redesign for Phase 2, which is now underway.  I’m planning to have that ready for a demo at Flotilla on Friday 4/15.  When I next have something to show the wider OGM community, I’ll be sure to provide a link in the Plex!

**Launch of Seriously App - Jonathan Sand, creator and developer** - As a conceptual contributor to Seriously, I’m excited to announce that the latest version of the app was accepted and launched in the [App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/).  It’s a knowledge mapping tool somewhat similar to Jerry’s Brain, but with some cool features for navigation, allowing for the collapsing and expanding branches and nodes of the network.  It also automatically summarizes sections of the network into a document for printing.  Thus, it serves as a writing tool, useful for composing essays, articles, books and provides lots of simple organizing power.  Jonathan’s superpower is paying attention to the little details that make the user experience enjoyable.  Try it out!  Go to the [App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/) and search for ‘seriously’.
