## A Spherical Model of “The World”
by **Ken Homer**

For many years I thought  of **“the world”** and **“the planet”** as referencing the same thing. But recent developments in my understanding now have me thinking they each reference something quite different. I’ve been working on a conceptual model to illustrate the differences. This is only a map/model and is a work in progress. It will, by necessity, fall short of capturing all the complexity involved. I hope you’ll find some utility in it and I welcome feedback to help make it clearer.
