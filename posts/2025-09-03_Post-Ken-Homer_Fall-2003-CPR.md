## Fall 2003 - CPR
by **Ken Homer**

It was a dazzling Autumn afternoon
The sun warmed the air and bathed the
redwoods in a golden-hued light
I had to run some errands for my boss
who was leaving for Europe the next day
It was so lovely I took the long way round
I had the sunroof and windows open
*Life During Wartime* blasting on my stereo

As the chorus of “This ain’t no party
this ain’t no disco This ain’t no fooling
around” came on a woman appeared
in the road and flagged me to a stop

Do you know how to do CPR?
Yes, I do–This was soon to be tested
I had not had a CPR training since
Boot Camp over 25 years earlier—
Help! I think this woman needs CPR!
She gestured and I saw a woman
laying in the middle of the street

I turned off my engine ran to her side
I took her pulse and a line I had heard
so often on TV medical shows ran
through my mind: Pulse rapid and thready
I never knew what that meant until
my fingers transmitted the message to me

I looked more carefully at her
She was maybe mid-60s slightly
overweight with a boxy plain face
Her skin was pale and waxy
Her eyes were open but blank and
unseeing Her pupils hugely dilated
I didn’t need a medical degree
to know she was in bad shape

I asked the woman who flagged me over
What’s your name? Kathy, was her reply
Please call 911 and give them our location
I took the prone woman’s hand and I tried
to speak with as much reassurance and
confidence as I could muster: Stay with us
We’re going to see through this–hang on
Just then she stopped breathing

Kathy we’re going to have to perform CPR
I’ll do the breaths and you do the
compressions–can you do that?
She looked panicked–I don’t know how
Don’t worry I’ll show you–it’s simple
Kneel beside her–you will need to use
your body weight not your arms or you
will quickly become exhausted
She got into position–Good now put
your left hand right here where her ribs
meet her sternum then place your right
hand on top of your left and interlace
your fingers like this–I demonstrated
Now bending forward from your waist
with your arms straight press down 2 inches
to push air out of her lungs then release
You need to count each compression
When you get to 15, l’ll give her
three breaths while you rest—is that clear?
Kathy looked stricken but nodded
It’ll be okay Kathy, we’ll do this together!

Ready? Begin! Kathy counted to fifteen
I opened the unconscious woman's mouth
placed my mouth over hers and exhaled
Immediately I felt my breath flow not into
Her lungs but into my right ear–Damnit!
I had totally forgotten to check her mouth
For obstacles and to pinch her nose shut
I did those two things and tried again

Her chest rose–I gave her another breath
Okay Kathy, start the compressions again
There was a cracking noise–Kathy froze
It's okay you cracked a rib just keep going
She did 15 more and I did the breaths

About ten minutes into the process, I had
the distinct feeling that we were working
on a woman who was not going to live
I noticed that she had voided her bladder
I had the strangest feeling that she had left
her body and was watching us work
Some part of me could feel her nearby

Just then a car horn blared at us
looked up to see a man in a brand new
Mercedes Benz motioning for us to clear
the road so that he could drive by us
lignored him but he kept honking Then
he yelled at us: You're blocking the road!
I wanted to yell back that he was a
complete asshat but instead I shouted that
We’re trying to save a woman’s life
He turned sped off in the other direction
Laying rubber to express his displeasure
My judgments about people accustomed
to privilege (it’s an epidemic in Mill Valley)
nearly got the better of me but I returned
my focus to trying to save this woman

I checked the time it had been nearly
twenty minutes since Kathy called 911
Where the hell are the paramedics?
We didn’t have to wait much longer
I could hear the sirens approaching

When they arrived, they looked over at us
Then they took their time getting prepared
I suspect that they could see it was
a hopeless case and felt no urgency
One of them was smoking a cigarette
he took a final drag and approached

Okay we’re here–you can go now
Kathy and I stood down we were both
agitated by the adrenaline flooding us
I still had the feeling that the woman
had left her body but was hovering nearby
I looked up and whispered to her:
Go towards the light that’s where you’ll
find healing and your next adventure!

We watched them put the ambu bag
over her mouth and start the compressions
The cigarette smoker turned to us once
more: You can go now we’ve got it

I asked Kathy if she wanted to go
Her eyes said no as she shook her head
We had both devoted considerable
effort to saving this woman and
neither of us was ready to simply
walk away just because the paramedics
had taken over for us and told us to go

We told him that we wanted to stay
Suit yourself—he shrugged turned away
They worked on her for a few more
minutes before loading her into the
Ambulance and driving off with no sirens

Kathy hugged and thanked me
We said goodbye to each other
Two strangers who would never see each
other again united by a moment of crisis
determined to do all we could to help

I returned to work and was immediately
assailed by my boss with several demands
She was leaving the next day and there
was still a lot to do to get ready
There was no time for me to process what
I had just experienced, nor could I tell her
I got to work but was in an altered state
I have no idea what I did in the remaining
hours before heading home that night

My wife took one look at my face when I
got home and asked me what happened
I told her of the afternoon’s events
We both sat in a kind of stunned silence
Then she suggested that I call the hospital

I did call them and was told that policy
dictated that they couldn’t tell me
anything as it would violate confidentiality
I played on her sympathies–explained
I had spent 20 minutes doing CPR and just
wanted to know the result of my efforts
I wasn’t after any names or details
only if the woman who was admitted lived
I’m not supposed to say, she told me
But if it were me I’d want to know too
I’m sorry to tell you that she didn’t make it

Days later an obit appeared in the paper
she was Carolyn King—a retired teacher
She’d been diagnosed as bipolar and was
living in a group home near where Kathy
found her–somehow Carolyn had
managed to pull two people to her side
so that she didn’t die alone or uncared for
We were there–we witnessed her parting
We wished her well–RIP Carolyn King
