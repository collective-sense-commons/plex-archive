by **Boris Mann**

*[ed. note: Sorry for the short notice! It*’*s the way the editorial calendar worked out. This event is at **9am PDT / 12pm EDT, Thursday, 16 March 2023**. We hope some interested readers will see this note before the talk starts, and we*’*ll try to have more advance notice next time.]*

​**Spatial Canvas Series, Part Five:** More ✨***Spatial Canvas***✨ explorations! Each of the speakers is working on building a spatial canvas-based tool for thought and will share about their goals and learnings.

Registration link: [https://lu.ma/tftrocks-mar23](https://lu.ma/tftrocks-mar23)

​​​**Speakers:**

- ​[Steve Ruiz](https://twitter.com/steveruizok) of [TLDraw](https://www.tldraw.com/).
- ​[Adam Wiggins](https://twitter.com/_adamwiggins_) of [Muse](https://museapp.com/). Adam will demo Muse’s take on the canvas including nested boards. Then he’ll talk about what they’ve learned from Muse’s users over the last couple of years about the canvas document type, both for individual and team use.

**Tools for Thought Rocks!** is a talk series about using computers as tools for thinking. Sessions are intended to facilitate an interchange of ideas and promote the interoperability of tools.
