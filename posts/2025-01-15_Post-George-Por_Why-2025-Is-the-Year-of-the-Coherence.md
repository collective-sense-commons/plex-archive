## Why 2025 Is the Year of the Coherence Game
by **George Pór**

*Continuing the tradition of a personal ceremony and contemplating where I am on this Earthwalk, what emerged from my retreat in December 2024 follows.*

### A birthday party
This was an unusual birthday party. I was not really in the mood to celebrate my b.day. My loving friends and family came together on two occasions to celebrate my 80th, but I desired to celebrate something else. That was not because getting older is not necessarily fun. I thoroughly enjoy this stage of my life and the creativity of a polymath, which manifests in many ways, bringing ever-new challenges and satisfactions. But this stage also gives me a perspective on what’s more worthy of celebration.
