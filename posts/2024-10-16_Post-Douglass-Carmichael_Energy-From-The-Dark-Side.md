## Energy From The Dark Side
by **Douglass Carmichael**

When major hurricanes strike, we hope they will break through the cocoon-like encapsulation of discussions and help us better grasp reality.

But in fact, destruction releases demons. This opens up veins of frustration and anger not usually seen.

Technical and economic discussions, which dominate climate change debates, are powerless to explore the dark side of the human mind. But the emergence is not altogether negative.

Serious creativity is wimpish and stuck in the conventional if it doesn't incorporate energy from the dark side. (“Incorporate” literally means “to pull into the body”.)
