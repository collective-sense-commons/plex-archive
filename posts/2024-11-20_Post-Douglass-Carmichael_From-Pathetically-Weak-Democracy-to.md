## From Pathetically Weak Democracy to Monarchy
by **Douglass Carmichael**

Democracies tend to concentrate power and turn into monarchies. We are full steam ahead into that cycle. A reading of history supports the conclusion.

The problem for us is that we face a society organized around Economics, and not enough on the quality of life and well-being.

But here's the rub. Climate change requires a centralized world government acting on the whole. The trouble is that the centralized government we are likely to get is not a bureaucracy of experts but an emptied bureaucracy in parallel with a poorly educated monarchy acting on its own interests.

AI will play an important part in cutting most employees, and the key issue I see is how will income be distributed, if there is any income.
