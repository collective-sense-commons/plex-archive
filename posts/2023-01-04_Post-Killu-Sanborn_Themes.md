## Themes
by **killu sanborn**

I'm inspired by [the video on themes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE) for the new year. Since one of my quiet decisions is to handle what comes my way right away rather than file for action, I pushed myself gently but firmly to act on Themes, as it felt inviting. Here is what I got:

- Winter of **health, light and joy**
- Spring of **strength, connection and emergence**
- Summer of **clarity and freedom to be my highest self**
- Fall - **we'll see**
- Winter - **I'll know the theme when it arises!**

*[Ed. note: When I sent out the call for submissions for this issue of Plex, I shared a video discussing a friendly alternative to New Year's resolutions, a "theme" for the year (via [Quinn Norton](https://www.patreon.com/QuinnNorton)). Killu was inspired to share her themes above. â€“ Pete]*
