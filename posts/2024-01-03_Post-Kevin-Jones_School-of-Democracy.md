## School of Democracy
by **Kevin Jones**

We are linking neighborhood economics work on economic justice with our local initiative on the rights of nature in the design of a **School of Democracy,** to be rolled out this coming Spring. Our first pilot will be with 12-15 people in the local area.

The classes in the pilot Democracy School:

- Workforce housing solutions so that people donâ€™t have to drive 40 miles for a restaurant job
- How to strengthen the local farm to table economy
- How to invest in local businesses at lower than crowdfunding risk with greater upside
- How to bridge the red blue divide
- How to subvert redlining in your community
- How to curb corporate power through the rights of nature and other solutions
- How to invest at a moderate return to bridge the racial wealth gap
- How to use giving to invest to become a more powerful giver, and how to do it in your trust circle, from Sunday School class to civic club
- The history of settlement and power in the place where you live
- How faith communities can get engaged in their local economies
