## Update from the Swannanoa River
by **Kevin Jones**

We have a bed and a roof and propane heat in an airbnb on the farm that was not flooded. And a neighbor with a solar generator and a well so we have water.

*Ed. note: Kevin lives along the Swannanoa River in western North Carolina, which experienced devastating flooding in connection with Hurricane Helene. Here's one of a number of news articles that gives a glimpse of the aftermath: *[*Asheville floods force residents to scavenge for water, food*](https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2024/09/30/asheville-floods-force-residents-to-scavenge-for-water-food/75444192007/)*. I also recommend *[*“This is our Sandy”*](https://substack.com/home/post/p-149683704)* by Susan Crawford, which reflects on the precipitation over North Carolina, and our “ferociously accelerating climate change.”*
