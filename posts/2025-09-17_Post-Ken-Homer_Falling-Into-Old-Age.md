## Falling Into Old Age
by **Ken Homer**

I am now 68 years old
I am strong and healthy
Most people think of me as
Being younger than my years
I like to think so too
But my body sends me
Undeniable signals that
I am no longer young

In 2023, while in Grosseto Italy
I set off on a walk around the City Walls
I walked at my usual rapid pace
The pace I have used my whole adult life
The pace that gets my heart rate up
The pace that gets me breathing deeply

My toe hit a half inch rise in the paving stones
I stumbled forward several steps
Trying furiously to regain my balance
Arms flailing, I must’ve been quite a sight
For anyone who was watching
Alas, my efforts were in vain

I was too far off kilter
Inertia overtook me
Hands out to break my fall
I landed heavily on my right hand
Unfortunately, my right elbow was positioned
Directly under my ribs
Which along with my knee absorbed most of the impact
(It was three weeks before I could
Draw a full breath without pain)

And my head bounced off the stone
I mean it really bounced
The way a basketball bounces
I was stunned
Hazy
Unsure of where I was
I laid on the stones
Sinking into their hardness
My body breathing me deeply

A voice spoke to me
Then, an arm
Reached out to lift me up
But all I really wanted to do
Was lay there on the ground
I needed to recover myself
I’d been scattered by the impact

He was Italian, maybe 40
Looking with concern at this old man
Laying on the ground before him
A wave of shame washed over me
I suddenly felt achingly vulnerable
How could my body betray me like this?

I didn’t know the Italian words he spoke
But I recognized the universality of their meaning
“Are you okay?”
He helped me to stand
Brought me over to a nearby bench
Where I gratefully sat
Still trying to reassemble my sense of self
Jarred out of my normal mode of being

“Si! Si! I am okay!”
I let him know with words and gestures
He looked concerned
After my repeated reassurances
He smiled and went on his way

Something was damp and sticky on my cheek
I reached up to find a trickle of blood
Oozing from the edge of my orbital arch
It took me a moment to realize I was bleeding
I looked down
My right knee was bloody too

Because I have allergies
I always have tissues with me
I staunched the bleeding and
Slowly made my way back to my apartment
A much older man than the one who set out
On a brisk walk just moments before
