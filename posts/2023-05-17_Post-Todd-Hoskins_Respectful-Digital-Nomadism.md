## Respectful Digital Nomadism

How do you be a long-term digital nomad from the US without bringing colonizing energy?

This is a question I’ve been asking. As much as I love the culture and pace of life in Costa Rica, I am aware of how bringing my North American money, habits, and proclivities here could be disrespectful. I am an uninvited guest, one who has even applied for residency status. Though the *Ticos* are accepting, and I have felt welcomed at every turn, I’m not entirely comfortable given the history of colonization.

While the US has never formally colonized Costa Rica, there have been a number of instances in which US citizens and the US government have intervened in Costa Rican affairs in ways that have been seen as colonial.

One of the most well-known examples of US intervention in Costa Rica was the 1856 invasion by William Walker, an American filibuster who attempted to establish a US-backed dictatorship in the country. Walker’s invasion was ultimately unsuccessful, but it did lead to a period of instability in Costa Rica that was exacerbated by the US government’s support for Walker’s forces.

Each year on April 11th, Costa Rica celebrates Juan Santamaría Day. Santamaría was a Costa Rican drummer boy who played a key role in the Battle of Rivas, which resulted in William Walker’s defeat. Santamaría was killed in the battle, but he is remembered as a national hero in Costa Rica. Government and businesses shut down on this day, and celebrations happen across the country.

In the early 20th century, the US government again intervened in Costa Rican affairs, this time to support the overthrow of President Alfredo González Flores. González Flores had been elected on a platform of social reform, and his policies were seen as a threat to US interests in Costa Rica. The US government supported a coup that overthrew González Flores and installed a more conservative government in his place.

So this is what I’m stepping into, as are many other digital nomads across the globe who come from colonizing nations. These are just the headline examples for Costa Rica, with no mention of the global decisions that have impacted all nations–Kyoto, Iraq, Paris, I could go on . . . So, how can I be an agent of repair rather than an agent of extraction?

After six months of living here, we have made five commitments that could be viewed as principles for being a respectful long term digital nomad.

- **Learn the language** – maybe effort matters more than fluency
- **Eat local food** – it’s healthier, more sustainable, and probably more respectful
- **Minimize comparisons** – not everyone wants to hear about how easy it is back in the US
- **Question standards** – does speed and efficiency really matter that much?
- **Mind the bubble** – expat communities are enticing, but is that where I want to live?

Over the next couple of months, I will share with Plex readers what I’m learning in regards to each of these commitments. Do you have some ideas for how to be a respectful digital nomad? I’m all ears, or *soy todo oidos*.
