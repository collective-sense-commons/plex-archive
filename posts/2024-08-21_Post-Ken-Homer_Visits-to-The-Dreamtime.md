## Visits to The Dreamtime
by **Ken Homer**

Back in the late ‘90s, I spent several years in a dream group. We’d meet once a month and share a dream that we had had. Then we’d ask the dreamer questions about what was happening in their life and what associations they had to specific elements of their dream. When we felt like we had enough information about their dream, each of us would say: “If this was my dream, here’s how I’d interpret it.” We’d each get four or five different interpretations to add to our own and no one was offering anything definitive, only their interpretation. 

My friend Len, who was in his late 70s at the time (now gone from this world for twenty years), was a lovely man who I had great affection for. Len was a paratrooper in WWII who had helped to rescue men who had been on the Bataan Death March. He was one of the bravest, most stalwart people I’ve ever known. There were many times when Len shared a dream of his and I’d offer my interpretation. Then he’d look at me in wonder and ask: 

“How the fuck do you know that?! I’m sure that’s right but no way I would have figured it out. I’ve spent my lifetime reading and I never would be able to make the connections that you do. Where the fuck did you come by all this knowledge? What do I need to read to learn what you know? Who the fuck are you?” 

All the while his blues eyes would be twinkling under his bushy white eyebrows. 

“I dunno, Len. It’s just how my mind works,” was the best I could offer him.

Here are two dreams of mine from that time:

- In this dream I am high up on a rock spire.
Very much like the one in that Isuzu [commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RZvK98FoEI).
It’s nighttime and I am staring at the Milky Way.
It is utterly dazzling, and I am in awe of the Universe.
I notice that I am strapped down to a table.
Three ravens appear behind me and start talking.
Are we sure he is the right one?
Oh yes, they were clear, he’s the one alright.
One of the ravens removes the top of my skull.
There is no pain but there’s a powerful whooshing sensation.
As if my mind was rushing up to become part of the sky.
The second raven hands three jewels to the third one.
That raven implants those jewels inside my brain–each one tuned to a specific frequency.
The first one replaces the top of my skull.
That ought to do the trick they say, and they fly off.
I awake filled with wonder, excitement, and a sense of deep connection to the Cosmos.
- I am driving down the road when my car breaks down.
I pull over and I get out and pop the hood. 
I look in and discover that the engine is made of meat.

Context: I was about six months into trying to be a vegetarian when I had this dream. I needed no interpretation from my friends. I went out and got a steak after this dream and never attempted to be a vegetarian again.
