## Social Hours
Our first stop on the tour is a distributed “place”, and currently sort of aspirational–we haven't heard too many success stories yet, the idea is still gaining traction. But we hope the idea will take off!

As you may have read in the last few BPDs, a few of us have started offering weekly “[office hours](https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/ogm_culture/office_hours)” (openglobalmind.com) of different kinds. Check the [Plex Weekly Calendar](__GHOST_URL__/calendar/) for office hours with **Jerry,** **Grace,** or **Pete.** Watch for upcoming slots with **Jonathan,** **Wendy E.,** **Judy,** and **Jordan.**

Jordan has talked about “pub” or “salon” hours, rather than office hours. These might be more of an informal social get-together or roundtable–we'll see.

For more information or to have your own slot added to the OGM Wiki and the Plex Weekly Calendar, send an email to [Pete](mailto:kaminski@istori.com).
