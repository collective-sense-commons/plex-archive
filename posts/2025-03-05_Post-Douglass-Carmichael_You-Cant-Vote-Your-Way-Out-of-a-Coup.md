## You Can’t Vote Your Way Out of a Coup
by **Douglass Carmichael**

The American Revolution was against King George, and was an effort to liberate private property from authoritarian control by a monarchy.

But the intent of the revolution was also to hold onto the private property of the class of the founding fathers. So in a way, the revolution completed its work dealing with private property, yet left the other half unfinished.

Where are Trump’s tax returns? This question emerges as Trump appears in the mask of King George, while the private property of the upper class in America remains protected by checks and balances, which keep anything from happening.

I would say that this idea of being in an incomplete revolution is the defining situation of our time. We have our work cut out for us.

The reason we are getting destruction of the government and no plan for what governance we need is because Musk and Trump see the power of the presidency as a means not to governance, but to private gain.

Neither Trump nor Musk want to be president. It is only a means to what they do want.

Trump wants to turn the world into a real estate deal-making zone. He wants to convert politics into a market where he can buy and sell and trade and get richer.

Musk wants to destroy the government that exists, to free up the tax money that supports it, so he can use that money to get to Mars and get a leading place in history.

The rest of us are left without a government. History suggests that it is time for a new constitutional convention, but in the context of climate change, it will be very hard to do.

History says you can’t vote your way out of a coup. The adequate response, albeit with the danger of civil war, is a counter-coup.
