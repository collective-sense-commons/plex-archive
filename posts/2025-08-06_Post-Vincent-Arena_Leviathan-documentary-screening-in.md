## “Leviathan” documentary screening in Brooklyn
by **Vincent Arena**

I’m hosting a “**Leviathan**” documentary screening in Brooklyn on **Sunday, August 10th.**

Leviathan is an interesting and thought-provoking piece that we’re screening at the Metacrises NYC community–a group of us who are figuring out how to exist in a world of intersecting crises and how to find balance within that.

The film explores the tradeoffs and tensions between embodiment and abstraction that have been coded into our society, including how many of our systems aren’t designed to allow trust to be scaled effectively.

It doesn’t provide many solutions, but I found it really striking in how it examines our orientation to the scale of our systems and the ways our bodies and minds aren’t keeping up–looking at this as one of the root causes of our current predicaments.
