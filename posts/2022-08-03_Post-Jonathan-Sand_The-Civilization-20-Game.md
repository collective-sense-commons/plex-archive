## The Civilization 2.0 Game
by **Jonathan Sand**

Out of the angst of a less than stellar career, I concluded (conveniently) that it was not my fault. Our civilization has not scaled well to nurture the human species. Lots of us are stressed, or worse, don’t fit in. This is despite the voracious consumption of natural resources, including the human energy.

I think nature is playing a cosmic joke on us and laughing while we grovel trying to figure out that life is simply wonderful. I don’t personally know how we can get out of the mess, but I want us to crowdsource it together. I want us to play a game which we design and enjoy together.

In my website, [The Civilization 2.0 Game](http://www.game.civilization2.org/), I tried to think thoroughly through a starting out plan and game design. It is a work in progress and open to feedback, collaboration, suggestions and merging with other plans.
