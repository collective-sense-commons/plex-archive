Donation-based, suggested donation is US $30.

[Ed. note: This event is taking place this week, and due to timing, much of the live event will have passed by the time you read this. Note that event replays will be made available to all registrants after the end of the summit, so you may still find it valuable to register.]

In honor of Earth Day 2022, Tricycle is bringing together leading Buddhist teachers, writers, and environmentalists for a donation-based weeklong virtual event series exploring what the dharma has to offer in a time of environmental crisis. This week’s events will explore three dimensions of the ecological crisis: the spiritual and psychological roots of the crisis, dealing with the difficult emotions that arise, and taking meaningful action.### Going Beyond the Clichés: How Could Indigenous Knowledge Really Help Transform the World? – Jeremy Lent in a Yarning with Tyson Yunkaporta, 28 April 2022
