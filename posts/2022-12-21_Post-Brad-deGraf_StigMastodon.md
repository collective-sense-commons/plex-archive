## StigMastodon
by **Brad deGraf**

I realized we at [NooNet](https://www.noo.network/) have some useful tools for Mastodon migration, so we polished it enough to offer it to others.

Imho it’s a lot better than anything else out there but I’m biased. It makes it easy to populate a set of high quality follows on a broad range of topics.

Here’s the link [https://stigmastodon.com/](https://stigmastodon.com/)
(Apologies it's Gmail login only for the moment. More coming)

Please try it out and critique it on CSC Mattermost, in .

There’s also a [demo video](https://standingwave.net/img/NN/StigMastodon_tutorial_480.mov).
