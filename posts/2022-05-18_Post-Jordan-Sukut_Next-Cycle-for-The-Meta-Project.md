## Next Cycle for The Meta Project
by **Jordan Sukut**

Hello friends,

**The Meta Project** is advancing. On May 18th, we had our final call of the opening 6 week cycle. It was a time to reflect on the value that was created during the last several weeks, and reflect on what we can do better, to create even more value over the next cycle.

Over the coming weeks we will be moving from laying foundations and orienting into doing the work of getting more concrete with the structural aspects of mapping, federating, and surfacing and meeting needs and solving problems as we prepare for a long-term engagement.

Along the way, we are planning to select a couple measurable projects to test our ‘muscles’ as an emerging community and see what we might be able to do together… Each 6 week cycle we intend to grow stronger and more capable as we work together to meet the needs and solve the problems inherent in this moment in history.

For whatever its worth, a few more of us now think that this approach may represent the best chance we have for 1) solving the total set of grand challenges 2) accomplishing the total set of global goals, and 3) forging the best and most flourishing possible future.

If you are interested in being a part of upcoming 6 week cycle, please reach out to [Jordan](mailto:j@lionsberg.org), [Pete](mailto:kaminski@istori.com), or [Wendy McLean](mailto:everwiseone@gmail.com), or find us on the [[Lionsberg] Town Square channel](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/lionsberg-town-square) on CSC Mattermost.

With Love, In Community, 
~ The Meta Project
