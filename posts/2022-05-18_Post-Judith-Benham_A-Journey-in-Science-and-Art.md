## A Journey in Science and Art
by **Judith Benham**

Vice Chair, Board of Directors, White Bear Center for the Arts
Fellow, American Chemical Society
Co-President, ARCS Foundation, Minnesota Chapter

I share with many scientists a strong passion for music and arts in addition to science. When I went to the University of Rochester as an undergrad it was as much to study flute at the Eastman School of Music, as for the science, as a Bausch & Lomb Scholar, majoring in Chemistry.

I began chalk pastel portraiture of the children of a summer boss, and continued chalk portraiture during my undergrad and PhD. During my professional life, as an industrial chemist (polymer chemistry), then management, followed by global technology leadership with labs across the globe, art took a backseat to work, family, and science leadership in the American Chemical Society (ACS), Division of Polymer Chemistry.

After retirement, my science shifted to National Committee leadership, ACS Board of Directors, and Chair of the Board of Directors, while my art shifted to water colors, which I continue to enjoy. Samples of my art are below.
