## Doug Engelbart**’**s 100th year
by **Peter Kaminski**

**Karl Hebenstreit** convened a small group on January 30th, **Doug Engelbart’s** 99th birthday, to talk about Doug and the impacts his work had on us, and to kick off a year of activities culminating in a celebration of Doug’s 100th birthday next year.  If you’d like to get involved, [email me](mailto:kaminski@istori.com) so I can put you in touch with Karl.

[Douglas Engelbart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart) (1925-2013) was a pioneer in human-computer interaction and harnessing collective human intelligence. Much of the way we use computers today (both laptops/desktops and their small cousins we call smartphones) can be traced directly back to Doug and his team’s work back in the 1960s, and there is still more to do to adapt and implement Doug’s ideas about augmenting collective human intellect.

Karl put together a YouTube playlist with more from and about Doug: [Doug Engelbart’s 100th year (January 31st, 2024 - January 30th, 2025)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZXa4I6EFfzLGc-DKzHEOxjef5Fb6Dvs3)
