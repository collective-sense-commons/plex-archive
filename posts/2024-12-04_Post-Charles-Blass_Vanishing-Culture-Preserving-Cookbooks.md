[Vanishing Culture: A Report on Our Fragile Cultural Record](https://archive.org/details/vanishing-culture-report )

In today’s digital landscape, corporate interests, shifting distribution models, and malicious cyber attacks are threatening public access to our shared cultural history.The rise of **streaming platforms** and **temporary licensing agreements** means that sound recordings, books, films, and other cultural artifacts that used to be owned in physical form, are now at risk—in digital form—of disappearing from public view without ever being archived.**Cyber attacks**, like those against the [Internet Archive](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/14/24269741/internet-archive-online-read-only-data-breach-outage), [British Library](https://www.bl.uk/cyber-incident/), [Seattle Public Library](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/seattle-public-library-still-reeling-from-may-cyberattack/), [Toronto Public Library](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-library-ransomware-recovery-1.7126412) and [Calgary Public Library](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/calgary-public-library-investigation-cyberattack-1.7353097), are a new threat to digital culture, disrupting the infrastructure that secures our digital heritage and impeding access to information at community scale.When digital materials are vulnerable to sudden removal—whether by design or by attack—our collective memory is compromised, and the public’s ability to access its own history is at risk. *Vanishing Culture: A Report on Our Fragile Cultural Record *aims to raise awareness of these growing issues. The report details recent instances of cultural loss, highlights the underlying causes, and emphasizes the critical role that public-serving libraries and archives must play in preserving these materials for future generations. By empowering libraries and archives legally, culturally, and financially, we can safeguard the public’s ability to maintain access to our cultural history and our digital future.Read Katie Livingston’s essay from the *Vanishing Culture* series, “Preserving Cookbooks”:
