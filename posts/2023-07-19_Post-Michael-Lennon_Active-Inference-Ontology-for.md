## Active Inference Ontology for Decentralized Science
by **Michael Lennon**

A recent paper that might be of interest to the Plex community is the [Active Inference Ontology for Decentralized Science](https://zenodo.org/record/7484994).

As many Plex readers may know, Active Inference (Act. Inf.) was derived by neuroscientists to model human cognition mathematically. Computer scientists have found Act.Inf. methods to be very useful in advancing Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence.

The paper approaches science as a collective process and explores applying Active Inference (and blockchain) to weave decentralized science into a greater epistemic Commons.

The paper is offered in the hopes it might spark insights or novelty in the Plex community for extending self-organizing collective learning and/or growing the knowledge commons beyond science.
