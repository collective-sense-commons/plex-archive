## Neighborhood Economics Course at 12 Baskets
by **Kevin Jones**

We’ve secured a partnership with the local [Asheville Poverty Initiative](https://www.ashevillepovertyinitiative.org/) to teach an 11-session [Neighborhood Economics](https://neighborhoodeconomics.org/) course at [12 Baskets Café](https://www.ashevillepovertyinitiative.org/12baskets) , the homeless feeding and day gathering place they run.

I’ll be teaching it with my daughter **BJ** as the facilitator, handler of social side stuff and interactivity. I’m the subject matter expert, or bring the experts or the people with the need, or whatever. Got it all mapped out.

Now we have a time and place, and we start in like six weeks. Couple weeks after the [Neighborhood Economic Conference in San Antonio](https://neighborhoodeconomics.org/san-antonio/), February 26-28.

The group I’ve been working with on **rights of nature** will be one of the first, if not the first, class.

We have 17 people going from Asheville to San Antonio. And we are hosting a dinner here on the 19th.
