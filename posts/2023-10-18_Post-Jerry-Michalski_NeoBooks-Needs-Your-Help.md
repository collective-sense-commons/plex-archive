## NeoBooks Needs Your Help
by **Jerry Michalski**

The NeoBooks project could use your help.

Klaus has a book coming together that features soil, water, regenerative agriculture, Spiral Dynamics and Theory U.

The NeoBooks project could use an extra pair of eyes (attached to a brain :) to read it for continuity and logic (vs line editing, for example). If it doesn't feel like a book yet, what would make it more like one?

At the moment, this is a volunteer role. If you're interested, pleaseÂ [ping Jerry](mailto:sociate@gmail.com).
