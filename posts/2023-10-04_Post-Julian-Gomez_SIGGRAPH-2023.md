## SIGGRAPH 2023
by **Julian Gómez**

[SIGGRAPH 2023](https://s2023.siggraph.org/) was held in Los Angeles during August. There wasn’t much relevant to FJB or OGM. As usual, the papers focused on very narrow, specific topics. The exposition focused on DCC (Digital Content Creation) and educational institutions. At least there were a number of interesting experiments in the immersive pavilions.

The theme this year was that it was the 50th conference. There were many exhibits of products from the previous 50 years that got resurrected, even to working order. The retro games section was full the whole time, and the post conference survey showed that attendees would like to see it repeated.

A major attraction was the time tunnel, which was 130 feet long with 14 foot high walls, displaying the last 50 years of highlights from computer graphics. Even numbered years on one side, odd numbered years on the other side. However, there wasn’t any detail, because the display consisted of 63-character headlines associated with each year. There was some talk of touring the exhibit, but given the cost of moving and installing it, that remains to be seen.

After exiting the time tunnel, there was a exhibition of ancient computer graphics hardware, by which I mean going back even more than 50 years. These exhibits were frequently staffed by the people involved, which made it really interesting. Also more imperative to record a history before they are gone. Ref CCGH.

This year’s load was quite a bit more for for me, probably 50% more than usual. This was first due to the fact that as next year‘s chair, I was expected to be the “right hand” to the current year’s chair. Also, because I’ve been in the field for so long (45 of the 50 conferences), I contributed quite a bit of content to the displays.
