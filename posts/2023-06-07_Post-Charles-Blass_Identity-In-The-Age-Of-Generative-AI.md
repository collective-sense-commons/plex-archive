Identity, and in particular our ability to control and safeguard our identities in the digital realm, has become one of the most pressing topics of our age. In the era of generative AI, it is taking on even more importance as large language models make free use of our online content and it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish between the work of human beings and AI agents.

With this in mind, we are thrilled to announce that Kaliya Young, also known as Identity Woman, will be joining the next meetup of the RadicalxChange Swiss Chapter to discuss any and all topics around digital identity with us.

The author of [two books](https://identitywoman.net/about/), Kaliya is a widely recognized expert in the field of self-sovereign identity and identity on the blockchain, and has been named one of the [most influential women in tech](http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/132/the-most-influential-women-in-technology-the-evangelists.html) by Fast Company Magazine. She is a co-founder of the [Internet Identity Workshop](http://www.internetidentityworkshop.com/) and founder of the [Personal Data Ecosystem Consortium](http://www.personaldataecosystem.org/) as well as the [Identity Ecosystem Map](https://www.idcommons.org/working-groups/mapping-identity/).

She is also an active member of the RadicalxChange community, and has spoken at several RadX conferences over the years on such topics as decentralized social identity, social technologies and their role in fostering democracy, and digital identity generally.

This meetup is an excellent opportunity for chapter members and others interested in identity topics to speak with one of the leading voices in the global effort to enable, in her words, “an open standards-based layer of the internet that empowers people.”

**Note that this is a hybrid event. You can join us either in person in Zurich or online from anywhere. More details when you register.**

For those who want to see more of Kaliya, she will be in Switzerland facilitating the [Digital Identity unConference Europe​ 2023](https://diceurope.org/), being held at Trust Square in Zurich, June 7-9. Tickets can be purchased on the event’s [Eventbrite page](https://www.eventbrite.ch/e/digital-identity-unconference-europe-2023-zurich-dice-1-tickets-567971838057).
