CSC Mattermost is a chat server. It is one of the core communication channels for communities in the Plex, including Open Global Mind, The Meta Project, and other groups and projects involved in collective sensemaking (see [Collective Sense Commons](https://collectivesensecommons.org/)).

Mattermost will work great in your browser, but for the best experience, install the dedicated [Mattermost desktop and mobile apps](https://mattermost.com/apps/). Use “https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org” as the server to connect to, and “Agora” as the team (if needed).

Some of the top channels to check:

- Town Square - mainly for announcements to all members
- [ogm] Town Square - the central channel for OGM
- [Lionsberg] Town Square - the central channel for Lionsberg/Meta Project
- Off-Topic - posts about random topics
- Tools & Technology - all sorts of tools and technologies
