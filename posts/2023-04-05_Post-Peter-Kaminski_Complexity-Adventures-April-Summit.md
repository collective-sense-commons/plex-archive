## Complexity Adventures April Summit
by **Peter Kaminski**

I learned about [Complexity Adventures](https://www.complexityadventures.com/) (fka “Complexity Weekend”) shortly before press time, so I cannot provide much context yet. But I think CA, and the CA Summits, will be very interesting and useful to folks in the Plex.

Consider saving the dates, April 28-30, for the upcoming summit. It's a 48-hour, around-the-clock, around-the-world virtual unconference, running on Gather Town. You won't have to attend the whole 48 hours, of course, just the sessions you find most interesting (and can be awake for!).

Join our next online Summit (April 28-30th, 2023): “Learn Complexity by Doing” with a diverse community of global Adventurers and inclusive Guides. Meet future collaborators from all countries, domains, perspectives, and levels of familiarity with Complexity. Your perspective is needed!I'll have more information in the next edition of the Plex.
