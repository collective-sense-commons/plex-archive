## Did You Know: WHO Mask Update
by **Peter Kaminski**

Consider this as a small bit of editorial opinion: you need a strategy to be informed about COVID-19. Our society willfully acts as if the pandemic has ended, even though it hasn't, and this affects even our national public health information.

As a tiny recent example, consider public health advice about wearing masks.

On one hand, the [World Health Organization recently updated (13 January) its advice](https://www.who.int/news/item/13-01-2023-who-updates-covid-19-guidelines-on-masks--treatments-and-patient-care) for anyone in a crowded, enclosed, or poorly ventilated space to wear a mask, “irrespective of the local epidemiological situation, given the current spread of the COVID-19 globally.” Previous WHO recommendations for mask wearing were based on the local epidemiological situation.

On the other, the [US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention web page about long COVID](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html), updated 16 December 2022, conspicuously omits any mention of masks in its section about preventing long COVID, even though mask recommendations [were in an earlier draft of the page](https://twitter.com/AngelaMSWinCA/status/1615010458867757056).

To borrow a question from the nascent SenseDoing group, “When would a healthy community suggest/mandate masks?”

Of the many existential risks we face, protecting yourself, your loved ones, and your community from short- and long-term effects of COVID is one of the simpler ones to take direct action on. Doing so starts with being well-informed.
