*[ed. note: *“*Tools for Thought Rocks*”* and *“*Tools for Thought Map Project*”* are separate projects organized by different folks, who are interested in the same things.]*

An update on the **Tools for Thought Map Project**, originally covered in [Plex: 1 February 2023](__GHOST_URL__/2023-02-01/).

We have started weekly open calls on Fridays, at 8am PDT (12pm EDT, 3pm UTC) and we’d love to have you drop by to chat with us!

Our project is currently best for early adopters. We plan to characterize a variety of thinking tools, by having people familiar with the tools summarize their experiences with the tools, and score the tools numerically along a well-defined set of dimensions. For more information, see our mock-up and project site: [Tools for Thought Map](https://tftmap.massive.wiki/?ref=biweekly-plex-dispatch), and to get in touch, read the [Contact Us](https://tftmap.massive.wiki/project/Contact_us.html?ref=biweekly-plex-dispatch) page.
