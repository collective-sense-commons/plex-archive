## Kernel, Wise Democracy, Transformation, The Platform
by Charles Blass

hi all

just finished checking out day 2 of the **kernel showcase,** great community with great abundance of talents and skills.

here is **day 1** which was super inspiring

recently joined some of the kernel junto salon conversations around web3 funding as well as indigenous protocols, with some wonderful folks including [Tapuya](https://tapuya.xyz/).

also in discussion with **Tom Atlee** and his **Co-Intelligence Institute** around a new framing of Wholeness and what Tom terms the [Prime Directive of Wise Democracy](https://www.wd-pl.com/prime-directive/).

further, in discussion with **June Holley** in connection with her massive work not only on [NetworkWeaver.com](https://networkweaver.com/) community initiatives, conversations and media storming, but more intensively around **Transformation** â€¦ stay tuned for more weaving around this ðŸ™‚ (hint: involves collab with **Vincent Arena** et al)

primarily, heads-down on building **the platform** dao â€¦ as pre-launch community awareness raising we recently put our gitcoin grant together:
