## (Short) Stories of What's Working
about **Jerry Michalski**

Based on an amateur theory of community change that he describes as [Storytelling + Relationships + Resources = Lasting Change](https://wiki.rel8.dev/storytelling_+_relationships_+_resources_=_lasting_change), Jerry is recording and posting YouTube [Shorts](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/K7bG2WzwgdQ) (60 seconds each) to tell the stories of projects that have successfully helped [revitalize cities](https://wiki.rel8.dev/shorts_to_revitalize_cities) around the world. He's drawing on [the Revitalizing Cities nexus](https://bra.in/9pKErj) in his Brain.

Revitalizing cities is just one theme; you'll see others [here](https://wiki.rel8.dev/storytelling_of_what_works), and can add your own. And that's the idea: want to join in? [Ping Jerry](mailto:sociate@gmail.com) to learn how to edit that Massive Wiki, or just send him email with a link to your Short, and use these hashtags with your short: [#shorts](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/shorts), [#WhatWorks](https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/whatworks).
