## Where White Folks Can Imagine Ceding Power
by **Kevin Jones**

We are in the early stages of convening some indigenous groups, for them to set the terms of trade for investments on Indian businesses reflecting native values. Such as, they don’t like exits; if something works, stick with it.

There is a flood of money coming their way–Biden money with a deadline and a focus on natives, so they are in a unique and probably not permanent position of market power. It’s early and it might not work, but any progress on setting a standard will be a win.

The easiest place for settlers to invest is into things that showcase the narrative of indigenous landscape management as the most resilient path to respond to climate change. It’s a place where white folks can imagine ceding power.
