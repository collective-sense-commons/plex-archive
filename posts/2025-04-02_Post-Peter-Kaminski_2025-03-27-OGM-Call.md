## 2025-03-27 OGM Call
by **Peter Kaminski,** with ChatGPT 4o and Claude 3.7 Sonnet

Last week's OGM Thursday call was very good, and I recommend watching the playback, if you like watching meeting playbacks:

Here's the call in Jerry's Brain: [2025-03-27 OGM Call (xlnt)](https://bra.in/4vPLwJ).

As a bit of an experiment, I ran a transcript of the meeting through summarization with both ChatGPT and Claude, and offer the following merged description. I aimed to give a taste of the meeting, but not a full summarization that might seem complete but wouldn't be. The LLMs created this meeting description based on my direction, and I take responsibility for its content.

The meeting focused on the relationship between micro and macro actions in creating change (“the micro makes the macro”). Discussion began with an upcoming Neighborhood Economics Conference and work with economically disadvantaged communities, including post-disaster economic rebuilding efforts.

The central theme explored how small individual actions collectively create larger systemic changes, suggesting targeted leverage points rather than addressing overwhelming large-scale problems directly. The conversation referenced the World Happiness Report showing Finland's high ranking, examining how contentment relates to expectations, social systems, and personal habits like sharing meals.

Additional topics included educational reform, AI's impact on learning, community-building through local organizations, collaborative knowledge systems like NeoBooks, and developing interconnected mental models. The discussion also touched on recent advancements in AI image generation as part of broader trends in digital creativity and learning tools.
