## Questioning the Need for Speed
by **Todd Hoskins**

Within the first few weeks of moving to Costa Rica last Fall, a local *Tico *remarked after learning I was from the US, “I don’t understand why you people from the United States work so hard.”

My first reaction was to be offended. Of course we work hard. That’s who we are. That’s our identity, especially being born into a protestant Christian family in the middle of the country.

It’s easy to interpret comments such as these as “those people must be lazy.” But that’s not the case. It’s neither negligence nor strength of will. The crew that is building our house work six days a week, eight hours a day. They take breaks and pace themselves, but what would you expect with the sun, heat, and humidity of this place? They persevere, but hardly ever rush.

In Costa Rica there is no need for speed, and little reverence for efficiency. The *Tico *who was questioning our “work ethic” was actually curious as to why we value our jobs, long days, and bragging about how busy we are. I started asking myself the same question, “Why do I need to work so hard?”

In the US, I believe younger people are asking the same question. And it’s valid, especially when you see *Ticos *enjoying their days and lives more than North Americans typically do.

The standards here are different. People don’t mind the bureaucracy–the lines at the insurance center or bank, the slow approvals, even the double check out (item check and cashier desks) at hardware stores. No one is trying to go faster unless they’re in the tourism industry. Then they know that bad reviews can repel the *gringos.*

I see more clearly how North American values are so often based upon “what I do” rather than “who I am.” What if I didn’t need to prove to anyone that I’m capable? That I “earn” my “living”?

It’s frustrating sometimes. It’s harder to be on a schedule when you don’t know whether going to a restaurant will take 45 minutes or 2 hours. Our permit for building took six months to obtain in a village of 500 people. But I also love the pace when I don’t have North American deadlines. So maybe I will start questioning those as well.
