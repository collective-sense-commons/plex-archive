## SenseDoing: Call for Participants
by the **Free Jerry's Brain** team

As previously reported in [Plex 21 December](__GHOST_URL__/2022-12-21/), a few folks in the Plex are groupforming around **SenseDoing** – notionally, sensemaking that is oriented towards practical outcomes.

**Bentley Davis** is running a calendar poll for a regular weekly SenseDoing call, starting with a first topic: **[Covid - when would a healthy community suggest/mandate masks?](https://zcal.co/m/-c8c9Bj_)** (**Note:** ignore the dates on the poll, and just use the poll to mark times of most weeks when you’re normally available.)

This first call is for bootstrapping the group – who would be interested? What would the group do? How would it do it? Here is [one of many possible ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MVqI8M_n925Fo5WYe07I1-auA4peqstZSWx6EmQ_Dps).

The current thinking is that the SenseDoing group would focus on sensemaking a variety of topics, starting with the COVID and masks topic. Not to be too meta, but the idea is to practice good sensemaking, not to just make sense of one topic. The COVID topic was chosen during a lengthy discussion on the Free Jerry’s Brain call of this week as a topic that wasn’t too easy, and wasn’t too hard.

To discuss more about SenseDoing, there is a [SenseDoing chat channel](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/ogm-sensedoing) on CSC Mattermost you can join.

***Free Jerry’s Brain** is a closed workgroup of **Open Global Mind** that focuses on collaborating on tools for thinking, one such tool being [Jerry’s Brain](http://jerrysbrain.com/). Email [Jerry](mailto:sociate@gmail.com) for more information on FJB.*
