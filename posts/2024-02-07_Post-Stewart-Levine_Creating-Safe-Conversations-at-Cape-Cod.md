## Creating Safe Conversations at Cape Cod Institute
by **Stewart Levine**

Hello Friends…

I’m looking forward to teaching at the Cape Cod Institute this summer. It’s a wonderful opportunity for both faculty and attendees. A week at the Cape, three hours of learning each morning and lots of time to get your feet in the sand and reflect about the state of the planet and your personal cosmology. It’s an opportunity to bring your family and hang out with them for a week. So please click through and look at the details of what I’ll be covering:

- [Creating safe conversations at work, at home, and in your community](https://mailchi.mp/cape.org/tech-information-for-your-live-online-course-with-faculty-name-15673469?e=4a234ade5c)
- [High Performance Collaboration with Stewart Levine](https://www.cape.org/courses/2024-high-performance-collaboration-stewart-levine)

I’ll be focusing on working effectively with others – how to build powerful relationships and sustainable collaborations. How to begin and how to maintain consistent progress toward an agreed and measurable shared vision.    

Please pass this along to friends and colleagues and [be in touch](https://stewartllevine.com/) if you have questions. It would be great to share some lobster!
