## Fuzzy Linking
by **Bill Anderson**

[Massive Wiki Builder](https://github.com/peterkaminski/massivewikibuilder) [v1.7.1](https://github.com/peterkaminski/massivewikibuilder/releases/tag/v1.7.1) was released with support for “fuzzy linking” (linking to a page in the wiki regardless of folder, as wiki links work in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and other Markdown wiki clients) and a sidebar on the wiki web pages.

Next up on the development list is provision of search capability for websites built by Massive Wiki Builder.
