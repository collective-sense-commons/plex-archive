## Mapping Disconnected Relief Funds
by **Kevin Jones**

With **Self Help Credit Union** and **Eagle Market Streets Community Development Corporation,** helped by **Warren Wilson College** students, we are mapping all the disconnected relief funds that are coming or have come into town.

We want to enable:

- Discovery, who’s doing what, then
- Enable cooperation by funds in the same sectors (housing, help to reopen a business, etc.)

Help us rebuild Asheville by giving and investing in groups without a voice at the table. [https://neighborhoodeconomics.org/help-rebuild-asheville/](https://neighborhoodeconomics.org/help-rebuild-asheville/)

*Ed. note: Kevin lives along the Swannanoa River in western North Carolina, which experienced devastating flooding in connection with Hurricane Helene.*
