**Meeting Summary* *by Claude 3.7 Sonnet**

Michael Lennon led a discussion examining how to respond to societal chaos and authoritarianism, specifically contrasting two approaches: collaborative engagement (the “carrot” approach) versus confrontational activism (the “stick” approach). The meeting evolved from earlier discussions about relationship-building and healing social divides.

Lennon outlined how the current political climate in the US shows concerning parallels to historical patterns of democratic breakdown, noting that authoritarianism advances not just through direct action by leaders but through how followers respond—especially when institutions and organizations preemptively capitulate to perceived threats. He used the example of a Washington DC health clinic that recently removed gender-affirming and transgender care information from their website in anticipation of potential targeting.

The presentation explored how collective learning happens in living systems, emphasizing that collectives learn differently than individuals. Lennon explained that during stressful times, humans naturally pool information and co-sense together to adapt. He discussed how language and shared narratives shape reality and can either reinforce social trauma or help heal it. He drew parallels between the current political situation and the AIDS crisis of the 1980s-90s, when activist groups like ACT UP used confrontational tactics after finding that polite advocacy wasn’t producing results.

In the discussion that followed, participants largely rejected the binary framing of the question. Gil suggested that diverse tactics are needed depending on circumstances, noting areas where opposing groups might find common ground despite different interpretations of shared concerns. He referenced Bernie Sanders’ current outreach to Republican voters as an example.

Several participants emphasized the importance of introspection and personal integrity when choosing how to respond. Dennis offered an Aikido metaphor for conflict resolution that involves staying grounded, embracing opponents, and redirecting their energy constructively. Susanna spoke about the need to avoid knee-jerk reactions and instead respond from a place of deeper wisdom.

The group acknowledged that the current situation reflects patterns seen throughout history, with Tunisia asking how collaborative learning and confrontational tactics might be combined at a collective rather than individual level. Lennon concluded by encouraging participants to engage in ways that feel right to them while remaining aware of historical patterns that have helped or hindered social change.
