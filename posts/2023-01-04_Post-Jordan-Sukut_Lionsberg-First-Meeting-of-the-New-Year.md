## Lionsberg First Meeting of the New Year
by **Jordan Sukut**

Bottom line up front: We are still here. We are full steam ahead. We are proceeding with ‚Äúclosing the boundary‚Äù around Lionsberg and setting up a formal membership organization so we can sustainably resource and support the movement indefinitely into the future. Email me at [j@lionsberg.org](mailto:j@lionsberg.org) if you want to learn more about joining our call next week.

Our call next week will be our first meeting of the new year and the start of onboarding. We will be closing all previous threads, resetting meeting agendas, functions, etc. for the new year, and starting ‚Äúas if‚Äù from a clean slate and building up the core functions and components of the System and Movement 1 by 1 with quality and care. This is where we shift from exploring the Meta Project conceptually and building systems, infrastructure and processes (2017 to 2022), to actually building the serving and enabling organization to empower it to sustainably rise (2023).

We will differentiate out into two groups ‚Äì Lionsberg members, who will have internal access to weekly content, meetings, networks, data sets, recordings, interviews, etc.; and friends who prefer to follow along from afar via a public facing monthly newsletter.

I hope to see you soon within the boundaries of the mythical and magical land of Lionsberg üòä It‚Äôs time to see if the small starting point we are holding in our collective hands can start rolling down the mountain and exponentially gain steam in 2023. If it doesn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ we will try again‚Ä¶ and again‚Ä¶ and again‚Ä¶ until it finally works. This is about learning how to do together what hasn‚Äôt been done, so let‚Äôs be patient, steadfast, and persevere.

I look forward to serving you in the coming year. Let‚Äôs make it one we will never forget.

With Love, In Community,

~ J
