## Introducing Myself
by **Stacey Druss**

Some of you reading this know me personally. Others have read something I’ve written or have heard me speak. Still, in spite of my efforts to be as illuminating as human[]ly possible, about the soul who stewards this body of Stacey, with the exception of a few, I’m not sure how many of you really know who I am. And so let me take my own advice and try to make it as succinct as possible; it’s important to me. I want you to know me.

**S**. Spiritual, Scientist, Systems Thinker
T. Teacher, Tenacious, Talkative
A. All things
C. Curious, Creative, Caring, 
E. Everything
Y. (?) Because it was the role I signed up for and these are the character descriptions.

C. Compassionate, Collaborative
A. All things
R. Radical, Rage
A. All things

D. Direct, Designer, Dreamer, Dancer (at Heart)
R. Rough
U. Universal, Unifying
S. Strong
S. Strange

Please allow me to explain that this desire to define myself to you, is more than just the shared one that we all have, to be understood. No, this is much more than that. I came here to you in need of help. Not just for me, but for **US**. We’re a team and I needed you to help me to help myself. You see, I couldn’t see what I can’t see, at least not from the outside. I’d already done the work from the inside but there were still some pieces that I needed you to reflect back to me. Then and only then, could I integrate this new knowledge and rework this System 6/2 Role Model Projector, to operate her system more efficiently. And that is critical to the mission. Until I was debugged, I wouldn’t be able to share the gifts of wisdom that I carried within. And honestly, they were becoming quite a burden to drag around with me.

In the meanwhile, I dumped out as much data as I could, hoping that some would see the shining object in the sand and bend down to pick it up. Sometimes, not in these spaces where I didn’t think necessary, I sorted my nuggets into piles and dropped them for others to explore. That was my favorite part, watching them build, and rearrange for their own needs, what it was that I had offered.

We’re running out of time though and I still haven’t been able to share the wisdom that my teammates on our mission needed; the update for their software, crucial for Optimization of our larger system. It’s written in code; The Alphabet Code. This code will unlock the key that makes communications flow. We will no longer have to swim/labor through floods of data to keep from drowning. And that’s what THEY DON’T WANT YOU TO KNOW!

I hope you’ve enjoyed getting to know me. If you’d like to connect and possibly engage in some collaborative writing with me, please reach out. I’m currently interested in creating a science fiction narrative that can help average people better understand what is happening on the political landscape from a higher perspective, as it pertains to technology, fear and greed.

#To Infinity and C-Ond!
