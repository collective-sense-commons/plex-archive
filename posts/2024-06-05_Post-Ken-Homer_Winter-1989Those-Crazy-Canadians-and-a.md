## Winter 1989–Those Crazy Canadians and a Brush with Fame
by **Ken Homer**

In 1989 I was working for Pixelogic
A third-party manufacturer for Apple 
We made the first video digitizer for the Mac
I was the National Sales Manager 
I landed a plum assignment as part of an Apple Road Show
25 vendors would travel across Canada for six weeks from February to April 
We visited: Quebec City • Montreal • Ottawa • Toronto • Edmonton • Vancouver

It was a young and crazy crowd of wild 
rowdy and hard-partying Canadians 
I was one of a handful of Yanks along for the ride
There was woman on the trip who lived in my town 
she worked for Adobe and was super talented
I’ve forgotten her name but I remember she
had dark eyes and eyelashes but half of her
left eye had blond eyelashes–not dyed
It was a striking look that suited her artsy personality
I was in awe of what she could do with Illustrator

Among the fond memories I have of that time
was when Apple chartered an L-1011 widebody jet
that flew us from Toronto to Edmonton
We were only about 50 souls on this huge plane
we had the run of the whole thing from first class
to the galley at the tail of the plane
There was lot of drinking and partying going on
The flight attendants were saints to put up
with the foolishness that we unleashed upon them

We landed at about 2:00AM in a deserted airport
Several of the guys got on the luggage conveyor
and rode if through the plastic dividers until they 
came back out on the other side
Others were conducting an elaborate ballet with the luggage carts
The lone security guard shook his head and went out for a smoke
This was before 9/11 when things were more relaxed

I met a wonderful woman and fell in love on that trip
Her name as Pascale and she was from Paris
I had noticed her right away but it wasn’t til
we arrived in Edmonton and a bunch of us went out dancing
that we really connected with each other
Someone had a joint and few of us stepped outside to smoke it
When we came back Pascale and I started dancing
we danced together for at least an hour not speaking words
but our bodies were having the most fantastic conversation!

Pascale lived in Montreal and I near Boston
I drove to Montreal every weekend for five months 
as we got deeper and deeper into our relationship
Then she took a job on an organic farm in British Columbia
As so often happens with long distance relationships
we couldn’t sustain our love without regular visits
But that’s not the story I want to tell here

When we arrived in Vancouver my friend with the eyelashes
told us that two friends of hers were playing at a club
She said they were on their way up and would be big stars soon
About six of us accepted her invitation to go to a club
I approached the concierge at the hotel to inquire
if it was safe to walk the mile and half to the club
Safe? He looked at me as though I were an alien species
Are there any dangerous neighborhoods to traverse?
Ah, right, you’re from the states (so, I was an alien species!)
I assure you that in Vancouver it’s safe to walk anywhere
I hope this is still true 35 years later…

We all set out and arrived at a club that could probably seat 150 people
But there were only about 15 other people besides our group
The lights went down and two women took the stage
They played their guitars so hard that they kept breaking strings
I was really caught up in their lyrics and the quality of their singing
their playing and their songwriting–they were ridiculously talented 
Thanks to Ms Eyelashes they sent drinks to our table
Then they came over and chatted with us between sets
We were all effusive with our praise which they accepted graciously
They were from Atlanta and had lovely accents 
We all enjoyed talking with them and listening to them
little did we know that just few months later 
These women would be selling out stadiums
Their names were Amy and Emily now known to millions as *The Indigo Girls*
