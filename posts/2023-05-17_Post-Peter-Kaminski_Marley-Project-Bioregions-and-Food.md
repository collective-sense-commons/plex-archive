## Marley Project: Bioregions and Food Systems
by **Peter Kaminski**

SenseDoing is now **Marley**, which is a cross between sensedoing and creation and publication of knowledge containers. See the [Marley](https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/marley) page on OGM Wiki for more information and links to other pages. Stacey Druss is project lead pro tem, until we charter some different org structure.

We want to get Marley going to learn by doing, and so we’re working on a [Quick First Book](https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/quick_first_book/quick_first_book), which will be about **bioregions and food systems**.

We also want to create the org structure for Marley, by coming up with a set of foundational agreements with facilitation from Stewart Levine. We haven’t scheduled that session yet, but hopefully we’ll hold it in the next few weeks.

The **5/22 Marley call** will mostly be used to discuss and form the **Vision and Intent** for the QFB project. Community members are welcome to attend.

For more information and discussion, see the [Marley channel](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/ogm-sensedoing) on CSC Mattermost.
