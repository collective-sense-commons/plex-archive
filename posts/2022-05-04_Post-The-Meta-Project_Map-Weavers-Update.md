## Map Weavers Update
**Map Weavers** is a new group with a mission to create maps that enable people to interact with data, produce the visuals needed for deeper understanding, match needs with offers, discover the synergies, reveal the gaps and serve collaboration. It was created in response to an RFG by **The Meta Project**, but it works on both Meta Project mapping and mapping for other groups.

On the Map Weavers call today:

- **Catalist** currently lists **33 people, 33 projects** for Map Weavers / Meta.
- Connections were woven between people and projects with connections, from which a **Kumu network visualization** was shown.
- **Jonathan Sand** showed his knowledge graph in [Seriously](https://apps.apple.com/eg/app/seriously/id1508392202), along with page view to PDF export.
- We brought up the idea of setting up a sync connection between the **Biweekly Plex Dispatch**'s internal project watchlist and **Catalist**.

Intentions for Map Weavers next steps include:

- Contact [Vincent](mailto:vincent.l.arena@gmail.com) if you want to help with Airtable -> Kumu mapping.
- Syncing the Catalist database with other databases.
- Creating outline for what will be built in the next 6 weeks, with Gantt charts / tasks lists / expanded lists of projects & people
- Journalism - sharing mapping info in a way that more people can absorb and contribute to incrementally.
- Supporting community building with mapping and visualization.
- Holding focus groups to get input on what people would want to do with what we have.
