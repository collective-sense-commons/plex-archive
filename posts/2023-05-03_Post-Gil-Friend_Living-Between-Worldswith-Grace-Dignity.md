## Living Between Worlds—with Grace, Dignity, and Power
by **Gil Friend**

Last month we began the conversation with “feel-think”—sentipensar—that juicy provocation from many Latin American voices. Ken took the conn, as I nursed a mild round of covid off-mic (yes, I’m doing fine, thanks), and guided a stimulating conversation about “thinking-feeling with the Earth”—thinking with feeling and feeling with thinking. What might that mean? What might that be like? What doors might that open?

This month? TBD!

Plex readers would be most welcome, and need to [pre-register to attend.](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIvf-mvrD8qGNUBS287pVRGQr77bUBhKQF4)
