## Questions
by **Douglass Carmichael**

Questions we will need to ask ourselves soon. Many people already have.

- Change fundamentals of the economy, or leave them as they are?
- Stay or go?
- What to tell the children.
- Where to go.
- When to go.
- Who goes with you? 
- Communications tech - how to stay in touch?
- Transportation - how to get there?
- What do you take with you?
- Food, water, clothes, cooking utensils.
- Important documents and records.

Some of this will be very hard, because desires become formed into habits. Some love the city, some the country. Money and food are important to some, not others, Some like to work, some to be recipients, some to take, and some to help. Erich Fromm called this “social character,” suggesting that societies shape individuals to accept their role in fulfilling their specific needs and functions.

These in the context of:

[The] death and deportation of  people is extremely grievous: all suffer violence, murder and separation from their loved ones. Even those who are fortunate to have escaped and whose love is undiminished [by the brutalizing effects of war] suffer from the misfortunes of their friends, colleagues and relatives. This [suffering] is shared by all men....Excerpt From The Golden Road, by William Dalrymple. It's a good overview of thought in Ancient India.
