## Complexity Adventures Wrap-up
by **Michael Lennon** and **Peter Kaminski**

The biannual [Complexity Adventures](https://www.complexityadventures.com/) Summit was last weekend, and while everyone is still recovering from the intense weekend, we can share a few artifacts to hopefully give you a small taste of how it went. Here is a recorded video of the Closing Session, and a few slides that were shared.
