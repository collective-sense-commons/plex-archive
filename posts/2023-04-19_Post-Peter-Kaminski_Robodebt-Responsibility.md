## Robodebt Responsibility
by **Chris Felstead**

Hi Peter,

I have noted with interest your and your contributor’s comments about AI. It looks like we agree about the hype and potential negative impacts.

I am worried about what is happening now!

I am researching an Australian case study called “[Robodebt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robodebt_scheme)”, which was the automated debt collection from social welfare recipients (without proof), accusing them of having received overpayments of benefits. It went on for six years and cost the then government 1.6 Billion Australian dollars in reparations, and later our High Court declared the whole program illegal.

Fortunately, we have had a Commission of Inquiry which has published the victims’ testimony for public access. It makes for harrowing reading and begs the question, how can we have so many ethical frameworks that still fail the marginalised? What happened to software integrity and beta testing?

The commission has concentrated on the bureaucrats who allowed the illegality to occur. I am more interested in the victims and whether IT professionals could have and do have a role in their protection.

I would appreciate your perspective and that of your readers.
