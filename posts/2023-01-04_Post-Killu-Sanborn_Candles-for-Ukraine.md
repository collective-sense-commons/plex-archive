## Candles for Ukraine
by **killu sanborn**

For your consideration: A good friend is partnering with the Ukrainian railroad to send 21 pallets of candles from Poland to Ukraine. Sebastian is a Swedish filmmaker working with Chef Jos√© Andr√©s of World Central Kitchen, living in Kyiv right now. The group is raising money via Kickstarter: **[Candles for Ukraine in times of electricity blackouts.](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seblindstrom/candles-for-ukraine-in-times-of-electricity-blackouts)**

A message from Sebastian:

Why do we bring candles to people ? Everyone has candles at home but they are low quality, burn fast and the good ones cost too much .. too hard to find. We will gift candles to people as surprises when they sit on a train going to a place with little or low electricity. It will be the most amazing candle they have ever seen, with an amazing message of Ukrainian pride. "The real light is in the heart of every Ukrainian". Blue and yellow. 90 hours of light, unheard of ! So.. these candles üïØÔ∏è are a surprise gift to people who are traveling home at a dark moment in their life.. a reminder that they are not alone.
