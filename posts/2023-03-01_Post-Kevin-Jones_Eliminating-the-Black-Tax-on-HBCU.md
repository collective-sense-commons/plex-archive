## Eliminating the Black Tax on HBCU Infrastructure Bonds
by **Kevin Jones**

Quick update: We are hosting a coalition of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) at our conference in Jackson, Mississippi, to meet with the New York Federal Reserve and bond rating agencies to begin to eliminate the Black tax on Black colleges bonds for infrastructure, which adds 2-3% more to the cost of building a gym, parking lot, etc. than white colleges pay. They pay the tax despite the fact that there is no increased rate of default. We brought this to the Fed's attention.
