## Map of the Future
by **David Bovill**

*[Image not included in the current archive. Images may be included in the future.]*

The vision of the project is that at this time in our history, we can, need and should work together to create a map - a map of the future.

This map is intended to be a functional map, that young people from all over the world, institutions, governments, and companies are able to use to identify interesting, valuable, and important risks, dangers and inspiring opportunities for our individual and collective future.

Humanity has been travelling for too long blind, it is time to give it a map.

The map is intended to have the following affordances. It should be:

- Fun. Fun, to build, fun to create, fun to explore.
- Beautiful. It will be an artwork at a grand scale.
- Pragmatic. It will be engineered with a combination of solid, and novel technologies.
- Useful. The map aims to be of genuine utility. We hope that companies, individuals, and organisations will be prepared to pay for its construction, maintenance and access to the insights it contains.
- Living. The map will be constructed through a continual process of data collection, and will grow, evolve and change with the times.
- Commons. The project will be shared and stewarded as a commons.
