## Now Testing: The Living Between Worlds AI
by **Gil Friend**

We’ve been training and testing a new AI on four years of Living Between Worlds videos.

Here’s my first interaction with it:

What’s the central theme of this video series?*The central theme of Gil Friend*’*s Living Between Worlds video series is to explore how to live in this time with dignity, grace, and power between worlds. The series seeks to foster an inquiry into how to interact with each other, both friends and foes, and to cultivate our tribes and our worlds. The series also seeks to challenge ourselves to think and feel beyond the nature/culture partition which has imposed itself everywhere, and to recognize that we are creatures of the planet Terra living with the myriad other creatures on this planet. Ultimately, the series seeks to move from a world in which life is the servant of business to a world in which business is in the service of life.*Not bad at all for starters!

Please let me know if you have questions you’d like me to ask it. (I imagine we’ll open it up to direct queries after testing, but for now you’ll need to go through me.)

To listen to these conversations with your own ears (and non-artificial intelligence), you can [browse the archives here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL202gED-y1zOml0saofx2Nk3E3ES28TMt).
