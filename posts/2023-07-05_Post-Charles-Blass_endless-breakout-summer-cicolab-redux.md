we’re developing and harnessing a collective intelligence workflow to build a dynamic knowledge repository in service of growing and harvesting collective wisdom while building a rapid learning network within the wisdom stack framework(cb cicolab summary march 2020)[The Wisdom Stack: Essential Elements of a Rapid Learning Network](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fJyb323YcNEdXBlhbMd5OtLd4zRhXJsd-dGkCysXGBs/edit?usp=sharing) (Google Docs)

By the end of the Collaboratory, we hope to have accomplished two main goals. First, we want to have succeeded in inventing a new concept and communicating an effective story around it. Second, we would like to have made advancements in the field of collective intelligence by trying new methodologies and measuring their impact. Many ideas that are put forth within the Collaboratory will fail miserably, but that’s okay! We know failure is an integral part of learning. What is critical is that we collectively decide what worked and what didn’t work as part of the process, so that everyone can take their learnings back to their respective organizations. Throughout the month, there will be a progressive, iterative evolution of the “Collaboratory Intelligence Toolkit”, with interoperable modules available to be repurposed for the next project, which won’t have to start from scratch but can pick up where the last one left off. – [Lauren Nignon & Charles Blass](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YM3SDs9fSSzBFMT9s_zJLr6pSyhjU1capPPi3XoAqfs/edit?usp=sharing) (c.Jan.2020) (Google Docs)[Lauren Nignon Deep Profile](https://youtu.be/wbLk_Nl3jUo) (YouTube)
