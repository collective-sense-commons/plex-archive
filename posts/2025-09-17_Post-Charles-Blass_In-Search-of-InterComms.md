## In Search of InterComms
### Plex Patterns Beat Reporting Report
by **Charles Blass**

- hellotoday (18 September 2025) is the 55th anniversary of the ascension of jimi hendrix
- it seems fitting to celebrate a great spirit and mourn the loss of a great artist and lover of life, while at the same time acknowledging the multi-hued greatness of the biweekly plex as championed by ‘csc’ comrade peter kaminski, now in a transitional moment hurtling toward the unknown.
- a handful of offerings follow, reflecting on the legacy and future of inter-community beat reporting and the tender origins and aspirations of ‘open global mind’ aka ogm.
- as we look forward, first let’s circle back, circa. exactly 5 years ago:“IF” (Interoperability Flow) - Charles Blass #OGM2025[https://youtu.be/eV_jokeDaZ4](https://youtu.be/eV_jokeDaZ4)
- (text spontaneously prepared and recited in a breakout room with jerry michalski and george pór, in an exercise of backcasting from...2025.)*“IF” (Interoperability Flow) -- by Charles Blass*
- *Essentially we’ve managed to map, skip and dance our way out of a huge mess, dodging bullets Neo-style with a huge load of painstaking grunt-work documentation, crap filtering, a tiny bit of tech, and especially gobs of luck along the way. Some say it was miraculous. Others are more self-congratulatory.... crediting the (finally) unlocked Brain power of Jerry et al, and a virtually perfect choreography of subdued egos, expertises and techniques, deeply listening to our bodies -- and Body (capital B, Game B) -- emerging, coalescing and executing a truly global meta-current, empathic conspiracy in the sense of Breathing Together in the Moment.*
- *From this vantage point I suggest it’s been a miraculous combination of Luck and the ultimate social technology: Love.*
- *We achieved Interoperability Flow! Wisdom Flow!! At Scale!!!*
- *Step by step, conversation by conversation, group by group and project by project, we figured out how to really listen to and hear each other. This was probably the thing that took the longest amount of time in the last five years. What did you say? Sorry I wasn’t paying attention, sorry the connection was bad, could you repeat? Sorry I & AI were too preoccupied listening to our own bouncing thoughts and agendas.... sorting how we could manipulate you ...*
- *Hmm so we also managed to crack the Singularity code and put leashes on robot dogs, yea that happened. They behave now and we don’t have to worry. We also also solved the conundrum of how to build and be decentralized in a happy healthy global commons, treating each other with compassion, equity and generosity.*
- *In other words, we designed and implemented protocols for Universal Deep Profiles and Hashbins, successfully matching ideas and resources in a global ecosystem of hashverses. Aka the 2025 Nobel Prize-winning Vibranium Engine. The engine room is — simply — the dynamic repository of interoperable knowledge repositories, written, run and stored within interoperable and freely accessible languages, tools and data structures.*
- *(*[*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibranium*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibranium)*)*
- *Collaboratory of Collaboratories ....*
- *How did we do it? If we told you we’d have to shoot you... haha just kidding! We freely share IP now, and everyone collaborates with fluidity around ideas and solutions, because we have achieved the Collective Wisdom to know what’s good for you is good for me. *[*Turtles*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down)* all the way down, and up.*
- [*Minimum Viral Upward Spiral*](https://www.collectiveintelligencecollaboratory.com/toolkit)*.*
- *Again, listening — deep listening — was the core to such Omniversal Interoperability and Wakandan Wisdom. Of course we had to take it to other galaxies ... where we discovered — with measurable relief, comfort and delight — we were returning to Source. That’s another story, still being written.*
- *So, the other key factor was house cleaning. Mucking through so much muck. At all levels and scales. That’s how we tamed the robots — sorted out their instructions to be truly ethical, after we sorted out global ethics itself. We had to take up arms (to get the proper attention and respect) but we — the real OGM-ers — did not fire a single shot. There were minimal casualties mostly from bad actors pretending to be our cohort. Bad actors became good, automagically. Our bloodless coup involved painting the White House Black (credit George Clinton for the blueprint), and cleaning our collective hard drives, caches, updating our operating systems, chat and social streams, data flows, and especially value flows. Engines, interfaces and learning curves are no longer angst-and-toxicity-ridden but smoothly purring, joyful, running on pure Vibranium -- Vibration infused with Love.*
- *¡¡Viva La Lovolution!!*

- (“and now, for something completely different”)**Cultivating Ecosystem Wisdom: A Peeragogical Framework for Inter-Community Learning***A parting gift synthesizing learnings from the Biweekly Plex Dispatch experiment*
- The Biweekly Plex Dispatch has demonstrated something remarkable: inter-community journalism can function as **peeragogical infrastructure** - what the Peeragogy Handbook calls “flexible frameworks for peer learning and peer knowledge production” scaled to ecosystem levels. This synthesis weaves together Peter Kaminski’s Plex practice, the Peeragogy Handbook’s co-learning patterns, Charles Blass’s Comms Gardening circuits, Tom Atlee’s Co-Intelligence dimensions, and June Holley’s Network transformation wisdom - offering both tribute to Pete’s experiment and practical guidance for future **inter-community ecosystem peeragogy**.

- **Core Pattern: The Peeragogical Wisdom Circuit****Heartbeat Rhythm for Co-Learning**: Peter’s bi-weekly publishing embodies Peeragogy’s **Heartbeat** pattern - “the recurring waves of activity that sustain the group” - while creating what Charles describes as **rhythmic, iterative** comms gardening circuits. This rhythm enables what Peeragogy calls **peer learning** where “none of them is an expert in the particular subject matter” yet communities **co-learn together** through systematic sharing.
- **Roadmap Without Fixed Destination**: The Plex operates as Peeragogy’s **Emergent Roadmap** - “a co-evolving plan developed by the group” where the path emerges through practice rather than predetermined curriculum. This mirrors June’s **Networks of Networks** approach and Tom’s **universal intelligence** - sensing ecosystem needs and responding organically rather than following rigid institutional structures.
- **Scrapbook of Ecosystem Learning**: Each Plex issue functions as Peeragogy’s **Scrapbook** pattern - “a record of the artifacts the group creates and the experiences they have together” - while demonstrating Tom’s **multi-modal intelligence** through integrating stories, images, and community insights into what Charles calls **community wisdom** emerging from **conversational artifacts**.

- **Essential Roles in Ecosystem Peeragogy****The Convening Catalyst** (Peter’s Role): Functions as Peeragogy’s **Co-facilitator** while embodying June’s **Transformation Catalyst** functions. The Peeragogy Handbook emphasizes that “sometimes omitting the figurehead empowers a group” - Peter’s approach demonstrates co-facilitation that enables **peer learning** rather than traditional teacher-student dynamics. This requires skills in **organizing co-learning**, **adding structure** while preserving emergence, and what Tom calls **inclusive stakeholder governance**.
- **Community Learning Partners**: What Peeragogy calls **peer learners** who practice Charles’s **wisdom reporting** by capturing and sharing local narratives. They embody the handbook’s core insight that “the best way to learn about peeragogy is to do peeragogy” - developing Tom’s **collaborative intelligence** while contributing to June’s **rippling/spreading learning** across ecosystem boundaries.
- **Cross-Community Learning Networks**: Participants in what the Peeragogy Handbook describes as **connected learning** environments where “participation grows from having a community of people who learn together.” They enable Tom’s **collective intelligence** while contributing to Charles’s **interoperability flow** and June’s **sharing patterns of success and challenges**.

- **Practical Implementation Patterns****Start With Peeragogical Questions**: The handbook’s foundational questions apply perfectly to inter-community learning: “How does a motivated group of self-learners choose a subject or skill to learn?” becomes “How do communities identify shared learning priorities across boundaries?” The Plex demonstrates **organizing co-learning** at ecosystem scale.
- **Technology as Learning Support**: Following Peeragogy’s approach where “we certainly have the technologies” but need better methods for **self-learners to teach and learn from each other**, automate technical processes (smart quotes, formatting, distribution) while preserving **peer relationships** and **co-facilitation** dynamics that make the learning meaningful.
- **Pattern Documentation and Sharing**: Apply Peeragogy’s **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle** pattern to replicate successful inter-community journalism approaches across different contexts while avoiding what the handbook calls **Carrying Capacity** overload - the risk of overwhelming individual catalysts with unsustainable workloads.

- **Critical Warnings for Future Experiments****Resist Single-Community Capture**: The Plex’s power emerges precisely from its **inter-community** focus rather than serving any single organization or movement. As the Peeragogy Handbook warns about **participation** patterns, communities often want to capture valuable resources for their own use rather than maintaining broader ecosystem benefits. Future experiments must maintain multi-community accountability and resist pressure to narrow scope or serve particular institutional interests.
- **Acknowledge the Labor Reality**: The Peeragogy project’s own experience shows that **co-learning** and **co-producing** at this level requires substantial ongoing effort. The handbook documents how “creating the Handbook was a training course and experiment in peeragogy” - expect similar learning curves for ecosystem journalism. Plan for **carrying capacity** limits and build **support ecosystems** that can sustain the work beyond individual dedication.

- **Value Proposition: Ecosystem Peeragogy in Action**Inter-community journalism creates unique value by applying Peeragogy’s insight that “any group of people who want to co-learn any subject together” can develop effective learning methods - scaled to ecosystem levels. It integrates Tom’s **co-intelligence** dimensions (collective, collaborative, multi-modal, wisdom, universal, and resonant intelligence) with June’s **Networks of Networks** infrastructure while embodying Charles’s vision of **comms gardening circuits** that transform “fragmented dialogues into fertile ecosystems of collective wisdom.”
- The Peeragogy Handbook emphasizes that **peer learning** works best when “participation may follow the 90/9/1 principle” and “people may transition through these roles over time.” Inter-community journalism creates infrastructure for these transitions while building what the handbook calls **workscapes** - environments where “people are free-range learners” supported by **profiles, activity streams, wikis, virtual meetings, blogs** and **social networks**.

- **A Living Peeragogical Legacy**The Plex patterns demonstrate **peeragogy in action** - treating journalism as what the handbook calls **“co-learning co-teaching co-producing”** rather than traditional expert-to-audience transmission. Whether through new inter-community publications, organizational learning networks, or movement coordination efforts, these patterns enable the **connected learning experiments** necessary for **Networks of Networks** to flourish through genuine **peer learning** and **peer knowledge production**.
- Thank you, Peter, for demonstrating that **ecosystem peeragogy** is possible - journalism that serves collective learning over information extraction, **peer relationships** over institutional hierarchies, and **co-intelligent** community flourishing over competitive advantage. The **emergent roadmap** you’ve pioneered will continue inspiring new experiments wherever communities seek to learn and grow together across traditional boundaries.
