## NSF Grant for Open Source Ecosystems
by **David Witzel** and **Peter Kaminski**

The US National Science Foundation is offering a second round of grants in [Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE)](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2023/nsf23556/nsf23556.htm) to support design & development of “open source ecosystems” to “harness the power of open-source development for the creation of new technology solutions to problems of national and societal importance.”

Several Plex and Plex neighbor organizations have been meeting to coordinate as they consider submitting proposals to NSF together or separately. They include:

- [Active Inference Institute](https://www.activeinference.org/) - Daniel Friedman
- [AgStack](https://agstack.org/projects/) - Sumer Johal
- [GOAT (Open Ag Tech)](https://forum.goatech.org/t/nsf-pose-grant-was-are-we-an-ecosystem/1459)
- [Lionsberg](https://www.lionsberg.org/) - Jordan Sukut
- [Planetary Care](https://planetarycare.org/) - Forrist Lytehaause

These organizations are actively looking at putting together teams, and would love to hear from other organizations or individuals who may be interested. More coordination and cooperation is better for everyone. Email [Pete](mailto:kaminski@istori.com) for more information or contacts.
