“[Through the Eyes of Facebook: What We Can Learn About Ourselves and Those Around Us](https://medium.com/@staceydruss/through-the-eyes-of-facebook-what-we-can-learn-about-ourselves-and-those-around-us-ee42d7a4bf90)”, was an article I wrote back in 2018. To the extent that anyone can accurately remember their feelings at the time of past events, I know my intent was to try to provide guidance that would aid in harmonizing the world that was being reflected back to me.

In that piece, I recounted my experiences on social media and offered some tools to help neutralize what I had perceived as toxic chaos. I attempted to be open and authentic, testing the limits of my own vulnerability with the hope that others would be able to connect. Now years later, I feel drawn to concretize the questions that every one of us are asked to answer in each moment.

Who Am I?

Who Do I Want To Be?

Who Will I Show Up As?

The first question is one whose answer many may never know, and only the most courageous will even seek to answer. The second is more clear and likely the one that aids in the enormous amount of cognitive dissonance that many of us witness. You see, our ego knows when our heart and our behavior is out of alignment. It will work to trick us into thinking it isn’t, just to avoid the fear of recognition. Once something is recognized, it must be addressed. And that requires **responsibility.**

**Who amongst us wants more responsibility?**

Surely some of us do. Is that you? Are you prepared for it? Will you work for it? Do you deserve it? Will you accept it or will you leave it to someone else?

**Responsibility Deserves Power.** It’s the work that is required to keep things in balance and operating at maximum potential. It’s the necessary ingredient in which **Trust **maintains it’s integrity. And it’s ok to not want it. It’s **not** ok to give it away to those who are ill equipped to handle it.

Maybe until now we’ve gotten that all wrong. Collectively we’ve given power away to those who haven’t earned it. We’ve allowed those who were unprepared, to take it; by any means necessary. And they have.

Perhaps we didn’t know we were doing it. Had we ever bothered to think about it? How much time do we spend thinking about why we do what we do? Most of us fall into the trap of directing that question towards the actions of others.

And so I ask you again. Who are you? Do you want to be responsible? It’s ok to say “no”, provided it’s the truth. The truth matters. Remember, it’s what sets you free. You do want to be free; right? How hard are you willing to **work** for that?
