## Toward a Collaborative Ecosystem
by **Wendy McLean**

I'm proud to present a new map, **“Toward a Collaborative Ecosystem”.**

*[Image not included in the current archive. Images may be included in the future.]*

The intention of this map is to illuminate synergies and possibilities, and ideally to represent those organizations, networks and projects that are likely to be of service to the whole of our collaborative ecosystem.

The map is published as a living resource on Miro, where it is zoomable, searchable, and regularly updated.

In the coming weeks, there will also be point-in-time snapshots distributed as image files, and especially exciting, **Vincent Arena** and I are hard at work on a **Catalist public Trove** for all this Miro data.  Thanks to Vincent's brilliance, the Trove will enable us to collaborate on this shared repository–to filter the objects, see everything in different views, comment on any object, make connections, edit and add things.

Here is the link to the map on Miro:  [Toward a Collaborative Ecosystem](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPlpxoeM=/?share_link_id=149420567606).

Stay tuned for updates!
