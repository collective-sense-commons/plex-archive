## Communities You Might Like: AI Salon
by **Peter Kaminski**

*Do you belong to a community that Plex readers should know about? This is a new series of short introductions to communities one or more of us are part of, that might be of interest to the rest of us. Think about writing something like the following, and send me email: *[*kaminski@istori.com*](mailto:kaminski@istori.com)*. BTW, I'm looking for someone to write a profile like this about Open Global Mind!  I think it's nice if it's a community member who writes the profile, not a community leader, but please check the profile you've written with one of your community leaders before you send it to me. - Pete*

### **AI Salon**
If you feel like you want to know more about generative AI - what it is, what it's good for, how to use it - you might want to check out **AI Salon.**

The Salon is an active group of “AI Adventurers” learning, teaching, and doing with AI. They have a two-hour group call every other week, which is one of the main events, and then ongoing text (and images!) conversation in a variety of categories on their community website.

I host one of the “spaces” in the AI Salon Technology Guild, called “[Learn and Do with Peter](https://aisalon.mn.co/spaces/12680311/list)”, where I demonstrate and teach beginning and medium-advanced AI topics, along with some basic computer things that help you get into AI more effectively. You can get an idea of what that’s like by looking through the list of live session recordings here: [https://ai101.peterkaminski.wiki/](https://ai101.peterkaminski.wiki/) - click on the links to find the YouTube link for each session.
