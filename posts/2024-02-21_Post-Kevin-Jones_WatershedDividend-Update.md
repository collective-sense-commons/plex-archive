## #WatershedDividend Update
by **Kevin Jones**

This is my progress on the design and implementation of the **#WatershedDividend,** a local, reliable source of abundance at the system level for the **Swannanoa River Ecosystem.**

I've taken steps towards hiring a student intern, and have already hired someone to design the fund and the dividend. Itâ€™s a complicated model, with some parts conceptually stronger but operationally questionable. To address this, I'm investing in smart young people to figure it out. I guide them by pointing where to go, give them initial research questions, partners to contact, etc.

The interns, of whom we may add more, will report to the young woman I hired to figure out the specifics. Personally, I prefer not to have anyone report directly to me. My role involves finding the funding and setting the problems to be solved.

In addition, I'm exploring opportunities on the new impact assets platform, where small groups can create a sub-account for investment purposes. My goal is to establish an investment club focused on giving to invest on this platform, especially targeting the biomedicinal market within our bioregion. This aligns with the interests of our $1 billion tourist industry.

I am hiring interns to conduct research in this area, emphasizing investments in Western North Carolina. The initial funding from me will be focused on areas where our **WatershedFund** is concentrated, following the principle of investing where we can make the most impact.
