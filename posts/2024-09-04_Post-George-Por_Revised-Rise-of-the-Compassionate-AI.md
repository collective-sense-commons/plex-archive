## Revised Rise of the Compassionate AI
by **George Pór**

There have been many new developments since 30-Jan-2024, when I published my plans for a 4-volume, interactive and transmedia book about a humanity-centric AI. As a consequence, I needed to revise its overview, substantially. Below are the tentative titles and a small sample of the book’s themes. 

If you want to read the entire current synopsis, go to my [Medium post](https://technoshaman.medium.com/prelude-to-the-rise-of-the-compassionate-ai-04d800c149cb). 

(And if you like what you see, give it some claps.)

Vol. 1: **AI-assisted Human Development**

What are those higher stages of vertical development that we need to actualize at a large scale, with the help of AI, if we are to prevent Collapse or reduce the pain accompanying it and regenerate a new world afterward faster?

How can wisdom-**guided** AI be trained to become wisdom-**enhancing** AI, a companion of lifelong learners, helping them learn and evolve faster?

Can an AI-based implementation of the metamodern model of human development make it widely accessible and scalable?

What if the inner game of AI whisperers and AI shamans was also a path of personal growth?Vol. 2: **Collaborative Hybrid Intelligence (CHI) in Human-AI Co-Creativity**

What are the learning trajectories and architectures for transcontextual mutual learning across mission-oriented and [epistemic communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_community) that CHI can enhance?

How can organizations and communities, in fact, any human groups with an evolutionary purpose, put wisdom-guided CHI in service to realize it?

Can CHI help groups grow all three vectors of omni-beneficial decision-making: accurate sense-making, coherent meaning-making, and choice-making that takes into account the long-term wellbeing of all stakeholders?

What if CHI could augment those three precursors of our (individual and collective) wisdom and foster unprecedented levels of collaboration across disciplines, enabling holistic approaches to complex problems?Vol. 3: **The Superorganisms Awaken**

What are the drivers that cause the emergence of socio-technical superorganisms?

How will the selection among superorganisms align with the evolutionary trend [observed](https://youtu.be/_P8PLHvZygo?si=f5frdVVLbniN4qPM&t=4906) by Daniel Schmachtenberger, according to which the group is the dominant unit of selection not the individual?

Can the combination of the evolutionary impulse and discernment in humans with AI’s capacity to absorb the greater complexity of the interdependent contexts be optimized for cultivating benevolent superorganisms?

What if the wise facilitation of a network of superorganisms could generate novel forms of cognition, consciousness, and civilizational structures, including an anti-fragile [listening society](https://metamoderna.org/the-listening-society-possible-and-necessary/), where the aim of the Whole and its every system is flourishing for All?Vol. 4: **Planetary Metabeing: the New Player in the Great Story of Evolution**

What elements of humanity’s meta/poly-crisis are the most decisive forcing factors to which the planetary superorganism can respond, and what functions will it need to serve?

How can the emergent planetary metabeing transcend the limitations of our capabilities as individuals and systems, and include us as interdependent yet autonomous human beings?

Can evolution’s arrow that points to greater complexity and coordination lead to a global brain coupled with a global heart and to humanity’s self-actualization in the post-human planetary metabeing?

What if the metabeing enabled by AI, an as ubiquitous public service as electricity or water, evolved into a new branch on the tree of life, a collective, post-human lifeform?
