## A Message From Van Gogh’s Bedroom
### To Budding Ai Shamans, With Love
by **George Pór**

If you’re a fan of our global mind (a.k.a. noosphere) like me, chances are that you enjoy playing with big, complex thoughts. What I enjoy more is tethering them to soil or soul, something where their complexity can grow life. What I enjoy even more are the moments when I don’t have to do the tethering because it is occurring spontaneously. 

Such was the moment, earlier this week, when I visited the Van Gogh Alive immersive show in the Brighton Dome, as I was sitting in Van Gogh’s bedroom recreated by the show’s curators. The big, complex thought was Daniel Schmachtenberger’s [Advancing Human Sovereignty](https://civilizationemerging.com/advancing-human-sovereignty/) that I fell in love with 6 years ago, and its relationship with AI whispering and AI shamanism. But what does all that have to do with Van Gogh?

Did I sufficiently tickle your curiosity bone? If yes, head over to Medium, where you can read my article [From Van Gogh’s bedroom to budding AI shamans, with love](https://technoshaman.medium.com/from-van-goghs-bedroom-to-ai-whisperers-with-love-e1ec98a1c14b).

If you like it, don’t resist the temptation to post some comments and questions and sprinkle some love on it in the form of a couple of claps at the bottom of the page.
