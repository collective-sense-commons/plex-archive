## Tools for Thought Map Project
by the **TFTMap team**

For early adopters from the **Fellowship of the Link** and **Open Global Mind** Â communities, the **Tools for Thought Map Project** published Phase 1 of its wiki website today: [https://tftmap.massive.wiki/](https://tftmap.massive.wiki/)

The group aims to characterize a variety of thinking tools, by having people familiar with the tools summarize their experiences with the tools, and score the tools numerically along a well-defined set of dimensions.

Phase 1 presents a demo mockup of a spidergraph visualization, and a couple of People, Tools, and Practices pages. The group will now start working towards Phase 2, with automation to collate of experiences and scores from a few additional participants.

The current project participants are **Mathew Lowry, Bill Anderson, **and** Peter Kaminski.**

Early adopters are encouraged to check out the website, and can join in by using the comment form at the bottom of each page, or by using Massive Wiki processes to contribute to the wiki website.
