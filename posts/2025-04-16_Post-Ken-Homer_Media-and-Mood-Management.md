## Media and Mood Management
by **Ken Homer**

*Note: Due to a technical glitch, this post was truncated in the last edition of The Plex. Here is the full post with links. –Pete*

Regular readers of The Plex know that both Gil Friend and I have written about moods in past issues. Mood, as used in this context, is an emotional feeling-tone of sustained duration that influences how you feel about and orient yourself to future possibilities.

Moods are complex. It’s possible to experience several moods simultaneously or in succession. Take moving to a new place. You might experience curiosity, excitement, wonder and a poignant sense of loss, either one after the other or all at the same time.

You might love your job and have a wonderful boss. This usually leads to uplifting moods where you see multiple possibilities and have both the desire and the sense of agency to act on them. OTOH, your relationships at home with your family might be under stress and duress which tends to narrow the possibilities you see on your horizon and can lead you to feeling trapped, resulting in moods of resentment and resignation.

In addition to being personal, moods unfold in social and generational dimensions. A majority of people on the OGM calls are Baby Boomers. The social and generational dimension of the dominant mood of the industrialized world when we came into it was one of nearly infinite possibility, coupled with an optimism that the world was getting inexorably better. Compare that to Gen Z, whose members have known levels of social, economic, and ecological strain and insanity that casts a very different light on what they see as possible. [For a fascinating take on the cultural moods of the current Seven Generations see chapter 7 of [Burnout From Humans](https://www.burnoutfromhumans.net/).]

“Consumer confidence” may be the best-known example of a social mood. When consumer confidence is up, bull markets rule. When it’s down, bear markets take over. This has recently been painfully demonstrated to millions by the imposition of tariffs.

In this moment of history, us-humans are living through multiple crises of unimaginable proportions. Some terms you may have heard applied to our situation include:

• the poly-crisis (poly = many)

• the perma-crisis (perma = permanent)

• the meta-crisis (meta = beyond)

• wicked messes (wicked = highly resistant to intervention and mess = an ill structured problem where those looking at it can’t agree on the symptoms let alone potential solutions)

• wicked mega-messes (multiple gargantuan entangled or intertwingled messes)

Whatever you choose to call the multiplicity of crises us-humans are confronting today, their impact on moods both personal and collective is undeniable. It’s even more distressing when you consider that these crises require us-humans to collaborate at scales and levels never attempted before. Yet, the mood of many people is one of resignation – “Good luck with that” and/or “That will never happen” – and/or resentment – “Okay Boomer, the world went to Hell on your watch.”

What’s worse, is that the leadership for stewarding course corrections that could avert tragedy is sorely lacking in both corporate and elected positions. Instead, the mindset of business as usual continues to apply engineering and technical approaches to living systems, completely ignoring that Earth’s regenerative capacities have been pushed [past the boundaries](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html) of sustainability and are now in varying stages of [collapse](https://www.deepadaptation.info/). This does not bode well for those of us trying to be good ancestors!

Mainstream media’s coverage of these messes is abysmal and the well-funded campaign to deny that a changing climate is now Earth’s reality is both wildly profitable and hugely successful. It’s enough to drive you mad – which is exactly what is happening to large segments of the population. If you are exposed to the news these days, your personal mood, as well as that of the tribe you identify as belonging to, is being impacted, often unconsciously, and to a degree most people are not aware of.

I’ve written in the past about the benefits of a media fast. A lot of people I know went on one voluntarily after the election – at least as far a political news goes. We’re all familiar with the tagline of “If it bleeds, it leads”, and how most major media outlets run stories each day that prominently feature calamities and disasters in the making; often told from a perspective that lays blame and creates victims. Media outlets know that featuring bad news is a surefire recipe for creating captive audiences and it sells advertising, so they keep it up even while it amplifies degenerative social moods.

When I was assigned a six-month media fast as part of my professional coaching course 25 years ago, I quickly learned that my daily ingestion of news was contributing to a mood of anger and powerlessness. It was revelatory to me to realize that my lifelong habit of being informed about goings on in the world was actually making me (and by extension, some of the people closest to me) miserable.

Unless and until there is some major unforeseen shift in the winds of fate, us-humans are in for a rough ride in the coming years. Events beyond our control can evoke deleterious moods. Personally, I can’t sustain a mood of anger, outrage, indignation, and powerless for long without dire consequences for my wellbeing. So, taking a lesson from my media fast experience of a quarter of a century ago, I am carefully curating my news feed today and taking media-free days regularly. I want to remain informed, but not so much that it throws me out of my center. IMO, it’s important not to be in denial about how bad things are, while also setting health-supportive boundaries by holding toxic news at bay and tracking “The Defiance” – a term Micah Sifry uses which I much prefer to “the resistance.” We need defiance much more than we need resistance. I hope you can find your way to being part of that.

Today, it’s not only impossible to keep up with the daily deluge of dismay due to the dismantling of democracy, it’s also disheartening and deleterious to do so. So, I’ve cut down my reading about politics to a fraction of what it used to be. I scan the headlines, but I only click on stories about climate, art, human interest, science, etc.

Here are some sources I turn to for news and information to keep me buoyed amid the turbulence:

[Letters from An American](https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/) – [Heather Cox Richardson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heather_Cox_Richardson)

Heather is a professor of history at Boston College. She places current events in historical context and while her content is often dismaying (because how could it not be?) she reminds us of how often the USA has faced similar dilemmas. Daily updates.

[Civil Discourse](https://joycevance.substack.com/) – [Joyce Vance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_Vance)

Joyce served for nine years as the US Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama. She knows the law inside and out and has many friends at the DOJ (or friends who were formerly at the DOJ). She places events in an easy-to-understand legal context and focuses on where the courts are holding the line and what can be done. Daily updates.

[Meditations in an Emergency](https://www.meditationsinanemergency.com/) – [Rebecca Solnit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Solnit)

Rebecca may be best known for her books, *A Paradise Built in Hell, Men Explain Things to Me,* and *Hope in the Dark*. She’s a longtime activist and brilliant writer and I love her ability to reframe dire circumstances as openings for action. Her column is a bright light in a dark time. Weekly updates.

[The Contrarian](https://contrarian.substack.com/) – Numerous authors

With the motto: *Not Owned By Anyone,* The Contrarian is many things, among them, it’s now the home of former WaPo columnist Jennifer Rubin, Pulitzer Prize winning political cartoonist Ann Telnaes, and lawyer Norm Eisen. It’s a place with live interactive videos, a daily round up of news from the Defiance. There’s also “Undaunted” a weekly profile of an inspiring leader who refuses to bend the knee. Honestly, this site has more content than I can keep up with so, I take small sips. Daily updates.

[The Connector](https://theconnector.substack.com/) – [Micah Sifry](https://micahsifry.com/)

If memory serves, Micah popped up on my radar a couple of years ago with some stellar reporting on the efforts of employees attempting to unionize the Amazon warehouse in Staten Island. The Connector covers a wide variety of political reporting, and I do not always agree with his opinions, but I do find them valuable and informative. Updates weekly.

Non-political news and other sources for staying sane

[Pluralistic](https://pluralistic.net/) – [Cory Doctorow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Doctorow)

Cory is a prolific genius! I don’t know how he does it and I can’t keep up, so his blog another source that I take small sips from. His experience from working at The Electronic Frontier Foundation gives him both a network of colleagues and deep insights into how important free and open access to the internet is. I am continually amazed at his keen observations and enjoyable writing style. Plus, he coined the term “enshitification!”

[Reasons to be Cheerful](https://reasonstobecheerful.world/) – [David Byrne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Byrne)

Talking Heads front man David Byrne started this newsletter a couple of years ago. Each issue highlights good things happening in the world. Updates weekly.

[Explorations and Explanations](https://xplaner.substack.com/) – [Dave Gray](https://xplaner.com/bio/) (yes, THAT Dave Gray!)

An irregularly published newsletter from XPLANE Founder and possibilitarian Dave Gray – who’s a regular participant on our weekly OGM calls. I don’t recall Dave mentioning politics much in any of his newsletters, but they a delight to read and I always learn something interesting whenever they show up in my inbox. Thanks Dave!

[My list of shows and movies](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10nrtZ3ndFvdVbBA65l_SoAOnJpxv6ln7/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115866380437705118974&rtpof=true&sd=true) – for when you need a break from the news.

Back in the ‘90s my wife began to keep a list of movies and live events that we went to. I took over the project from her in the early 2000s and it has grown into a spreadsheet with over 1,500 entries that encompass everything from the beautiful animation of Studio Ghibli to political and nature documentaries to kids movies to British detective shows to juvenile humor (Clerks or Bridesmaids anyone?) to serious science shows.

Final thought. Here is the text of the Fifth of the Five Wonderful Precepts as articulated by Thich Nhat Hahn:

*Aware of the suffering caused by unmindful consumption, I vow to cultivate good health, both physical and mental, for myself, my family, and my society by practicing mindful eating, drinking and consuming. I vow to ingest only items that preserve peace, well-being and joy in my body, in my consciousness, and in the collective body and consciousness of my family and society. I am determined not to use alcohol or any other intoxicant or to ingest foods or other items that contain toxins, such as certain TV programs, magazines, books, films and conversations. I am aware that to damage my body or my consciousness with these poisons is to betray my ancestors, my parents, my society and future generations. I will work to transform violence, fear, anger and confusion in myself and in society by practicing a diet for myself and for society. I understand that a proper diet is crucial for self-transformation and for the transformation of society.*

As Joyce Vance says at the close of all her newsletters:

We’re in this together.
