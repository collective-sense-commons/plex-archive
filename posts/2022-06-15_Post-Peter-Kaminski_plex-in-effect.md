locally here in z√ºrich there‚Äôs been some extra activity around NFTs. on the weekend i had a chance to meet some jetsetting friends of friends, now my friends, hear and have some generative discussions around the corner at the **kunsthaus**

fundamentally despite rampant noise and crap i am super excited by what‚Äôs evolving in the nft space and our team at **the platform** is encouraged to move forward and build cutting edge open source web3 tooling in the bear market without so much distraction.

hints of what else is transpiring behind the scenes:

- community gardening patterning
- trust commons based decisionmaking
- purpose driven smart contracts
- impactdao knowledge graphing

ok i didn‚Äôt want this to be so long however i must add something here about the indefatigable **peter kaminski** and the [plex](__GHOST_URL__/). maybe suffice to say what i said on twitter, plus i invited pete to express the plex process flow in terms of patterns for spreading between communities, such as for the **impactdao** space, prompted by the open request of **kevin owocki** of **gitcoin.** there is definitely a need for this sort of community driven beat reporting everywhere, in every community, though most have no awareness or practice yet. this is so far beyond ‚Äúnewsletter‚Äù. the effects for me since its inception have already been profound. and the process is impressive, though not as impressive as pete‚Äôs generosity, kindness, patience, foresight, and willingness to go the distance. thank you again peter k!!! when you get around to it pls ask your clone to observe you and thoroughly document the plex process. rinse and repeat üôåüèº

[Aw, shucks. Thank you, Charles! The clone has promised to document Plex patterns‚ÄìI'm looking forward to it! üôÇ - PK]
