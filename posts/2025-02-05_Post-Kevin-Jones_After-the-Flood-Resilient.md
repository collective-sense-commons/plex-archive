## After the Flood: Resilient Entrepreneurial Ecosystems

by **Kevin Jones**

Rosa Lee and I, a month after our Neighborhood Economics gathering in April, will cruise to Spain and spend a couple of months. We don’t know what we will do next. We are looking for cities that could use our skills to catalyze a system shift if we started talking to people there and then moved there for three months.

We will also most likely continue to do a conference in Asheville every Spring. Right now it’s focused on the post-disaster economy; what innovations do you have that work now that would help us preserve and extend our nascent economy of reciprocity that’s sprouted post Helene? What do you have that looks like it will work, ready to launch, maybe here. And what do you have that could work if, the right puzzle pieces of the ecosystem come together.

The Swannanoa took our house and farm where we’ve lived for 15 years with our kids and grandkids. So we are free to move, while staying connected here. The model for the event is like PopTech, that took over Portland, Maine, but focused on healing and regenerating Asheville and helping us do more of what we have already started with an amazingly skilled mutual aid network, often with remote leadership.

Join us in Helene-devastated Asheville to discover the resilient entrepreneurial ecosystem, April 1-2: [https://neighborhoodeconomics.org/asheville/](https://neighborhoodeconomics.org/asheville/)
