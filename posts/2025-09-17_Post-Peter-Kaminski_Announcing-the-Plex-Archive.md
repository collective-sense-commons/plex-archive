## Announcing the Plex Archive
by **Peter Kaminski**

Plex so far: 3.6 years, 87 issues, 614 posts, 51 authors. To celebrate, I rolled up my sleeves and created the [Plex Archive](https://plex-archive.collectivesensecommons.org/), a web site containing all the posts from Plex so far, separated out as individual posts and indexed by issue, author, year, and topic. Please check it out–it’s pretty cool!

It’s about 95% done. It was a fair amount of work, with me directing Claude Code to write and rewrite a Python data extraction / conversion script. There are still things not quite right, but it’s already super easy to browse through, and each post has a link back to the issue it comes from, so you can see the post in its original context, complete with its images or videos.

If you’re one of those folks who just want to shovel text into their AI’s waiting maw, here’s a [zip of all the Plex posts so far in Markdown text format](https://plex-archive.collectivesensecommons.org/plex-archive-posts.zip).

I’ll keep working on the Plex Archive once in a while to improve it. Let me know if you’d like to help (or if you re-discover anything cool)!
