## Duo Talks: A Common-Sense Collaboration
by **Jerry Michalski**

MyÂ [better half](http://aprilrinne.com/)Â and IÂ [both](http://jerrymichalski.com/)Â give keynote speeches for a living, and so far, the more successful we are, the more time we end up spending apart ðŸ¥º. EnterÂ [the Duo talk](http://aprilandjerry.com/): book us both, and we'll each give a talk, plus we'll add in a multiple-choice bonus session. All for less than the sum of our individual fees.

While duo talks will help us travel together more, that's not the main reason we've just launched this offer. The biggie is how nicely our themes and insights weave into and support one another. Where April talks about adopting a Flux Mindset by practicing eight Superpowers that can help all of us cope with the never-ending waves of change that keep breaking over us, I talk about using that wave energy to catalyze changes you want, often by examining your constraints in new ways. I help them rethink their futures,Â then help make them real.

We're both about seeing differently, trust, and letting go of old beliefs. We've already been helping one another with content and approaches for a longÂ time. This is a lovely level-up for us.

The challenge is that the unit of sale in the keynote market is the single speech. Duos are rare. We're proposing to help event producers schedule an entire morning or afternoon, with less complexity (one contract) and some fee savings. This is the key thing we're experimenting with now, so please send any insights our way.
