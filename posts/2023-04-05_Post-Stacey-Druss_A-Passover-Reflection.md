## A Passover Reflection
by **Stacey Druss**

I listened from the back, as the Rabbi asked the question, “Why be a Jew?” His response was that he did not know. My heart called out,” I know, I know, we are Jews because through birth or circumstance, we are called. It is the path that is tailor made for us.” There are many ways to realize God. Our job is to find the one that is best suited for us. There should be no judgments. We are all perfectly different and different in our perfection. It is our job to honor our differences and those of others. There is no room for blame, guilt or judgment.

Rabbi stated, “We are always asking questions yet still don’t have the answer.” My heart called out, “Maybe we are not meant to answer the question; perhaps it is just the search that Matters.”

I sat in the back of the synagogue missing my Rabbi that was unexplainably absent. We had been told he had a condition that prevented him from fulfilling his duties and would not return for some time. The details were vague and while many tried to live true to the words of the Torah and not speak gossip; others were not strong enough to live up to their potential. I tried not to judge. I couldn't help feeling protective over him though.

We had become close, as I had joined a Torah Study program that he had initiated. I wanted to learn firsthand the basis for this religion that I was beginning to feel drawn to. Until now being Jewish was just a name I called myself. Now, I wanted to know why.  I was attracted to the notion that as Reform Jews we are not only allowed to question; we are encouraged to do so. It is in the questioning that we discover what has been hidden. It is in the uncovering of the teachings that we bring the Torah to life.

Now, in the absence of my beloved Rabbi, as well as our Cantor who had been away overseas,  I listened to Rabbi Emeritus. With no compensation, he gave of himself to ensure that the links of our congregation would not be weakened. I marveled at the analogies that were enacting before my eyes. Members of the choir, in the absence of their Cantor, finding the strength to step up and carry out that which our congregation yearned for. Although the beauty of the Cantor’s voice was unparalleled, somehow the spirit of the choir made its absence less noticed.

Together their voices lifted my soul and brought me to tears.  I later learned from some members how difficult an endeavor it had been. Many were nervous without her leadership, but still something from within guided them to perform. When called upon, they came through. It reminded me of the slaves in Egypt. Together they had crossed the sea and against all odds, had prevailed. Together on this day, we prevailed.

Rabbi spoke of the importance of hope and of the realization that we are all co-creators with God. I thought about the sadness we were facing at not having our Rabbi present, and the hardships that had been a result of that. My heart felt full, as I watched how we as a people had joined together to carry on.

For some reason, I have never questioned God's intentions for allowing bad things to happen. For me it has always been clear that difficult times come laden with opportunities. I know that these are the times that offer the spirit within us the chance to soar. These are the times that call upon our courage to lift us to our potential.

I often see the parallels between the days I learned about in Torah study, and the days that I watch play out now. I recognize the sincere and the misguided. I cling to the nuggets of wisdom that I learned about in that class; the warnings against gossip. I pray alone and I pray in community. I live with hope in my heart that the foundation laid before me, will remind me to act accordingly. I remember that the Torah is alive through me. I ask myself how I will want it to read.

Moses was not able to enter the promised land, yet by all accounts he was an extraordinary leader. A great leader is not one who is perfect. A great leader is one who through example, shows  the way to overcome difficult circumstances. Each of us, I believe, is now being called upon to lead.  We have before us, an opportunity to share the gifts within; to be the blessings we were meant to be. We are not separate. We are each a spark of the Divine. Let this moment be our time to join together and shine. Chag Sameach! <3 

Note: Today I woke up remembering this song by Josh Nelson. It’s one I carry in my heart. It forever connects me to a moment in time, and all that is. I’d like to share it with you.

We are gifts and we are blessings
We are history in song.
We are hope and we are healing
We are learning to be strong.
We are words and we are stories
We are pictures of the past.
We are carriers of wisdom
Not the first and not the last
