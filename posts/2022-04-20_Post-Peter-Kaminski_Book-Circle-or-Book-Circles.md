# Book Circle, or Book Circles?

## Book Circle, or Book Circles?
The [Dawn of Everything Book Circle](https://doe.bookcircle.academy/) held its Chapter 1 meetings last week, and will have Chapter 2 meetings next week, on 26 April and 28 April.

**Peter Kaminski** is helping the members capture meeting artifacts – collaboratively edited notes, Zoom chat, and machine transcriptions:

- [Ch. 1 - Dawn of Everything Book Circle (Chapter 1 meeting 1 of 2)](https://doe.bookcircle.academy/ch._1_-_dawn_of_everything_book_circle_(chapter_1_meeting_1_of_2))
- [Ch. 1 - Dawn of Everything Book Circle (Chapter 1 meeting 2 of 2)](https://doe.bookcircle.academy/ch._1_-_dawn_of_everything_book_circle_(chapter_1_meeting_2_of_2))

Pete, **Bill Anderson**, and others will continue to flesh out the wiki website as the discussion unfolds.

**Ken** and Pete have started to wonder if it would be possible to run a **Sand Talk** (book by **Tyson Yunkaporta**) book circle concurrently.  What do you think?

And it turns out that **Wikipedia** does not yet have pages for Tyson Yunkaporta or for Sand Talk! Would you be interested in joining a small but intrepid group of Dawn of Everything Book Circle/OGM explorers on a project to create them?

Join in or discuss more in the [Dawn of Everything](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/dawn-of-everything) channel on CSC Mattermost.
