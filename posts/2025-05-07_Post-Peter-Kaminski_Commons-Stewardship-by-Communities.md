## Commons Stewardship by Communities Project
by **Peter Kaminski**

I created a draft primer on Commons Stewardship by Communities, exploring how communities collectively manage things that are “commons” (shared resources), ranging from natural environments to digital assets. The bibliographic-heavy document covers theoretical foundations, governance principles, case study summaries (including open-source conflicts), community currencies, and key thinkers in the movement.

I posted the draft to the OGM mailing list, asking for help with proofreading and taking editorial responsibility for the content, and a number of wonderful folks chimed in as ready to help. I think I’ll set it up for publishing from a Git repo in Codeberg, mirrored to GitHub, and get the ball rolling on prepping it for publication.

If you’d like to know more or get involved, send me an email: [kaminski@istori.com](mailto:kaminski@istori.com).
