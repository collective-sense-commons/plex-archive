## Can You Let the Mud Settle, Until Clarity Emerges
by **Charles Blass**

required listening for our community.

arguably daniel schmachtenberger*’*s most efficient distillation, from a few weeks ago:

*[Image not included in the current archive. Images may be included in the future.]*

*Ed. note, the title, *Can You Let the Mud Settle, Until Clarity Emerges, *comes from the end of Schmachtenberger’s discussion.*

*And now, we ask for a little forbearance and intelligence from Plex readers. Charles’ statement above is simple, declarative, and obvious. Watch the video!*

*And, Pete is working with GPT-4 on experimental summarization of longer transcripts, and for this edition of the Plex, asked about the video above, *“*Write a short summary of [the transcript of this video] that would help me understand what this talk was about, and would help me know if I want to listen to the whole thing.*”

*The following, written by GPT-4 after examining the transcript, is not a replacement for listening to the talk; but rather, is intended to be another tool to help you to choose to listen with your human eyes, ears, and brain.*

This talk explores the intersections of socio-economic systems, capital, and technology, advocating for their reformation towards sustainability. The speaker critically examines the destructive impacts of our current systems, especially the treatment of nature as a commodity for unending profit. They propose holistic and ecosystem-based thinking to replace the continuous growth mindset. Additionally, they provide advice for impact investors, emphasizing the need for self-sustaining systems and closed-loop technologies. Challenging prevailing narratives of progress and innovation, the speaker encourages a deeper, more holistic understanding of value. The talk concludes with a call to align with nature, value deep insights, and collaborate for natural stewardship. This talk could interest those engaged in socio-economic structures, sustainable investment, technology, and environmental stewardship.
