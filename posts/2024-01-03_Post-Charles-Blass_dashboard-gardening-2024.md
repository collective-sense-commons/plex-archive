## dashboard gardening 2024
by **charles blass**

*Canonically published at: *[*dashboard gardening 2024*](https://weco.io/p/7199)

gathering from the compost of last year and next
for inclusion in 'the plex', 'world wise web' and beyond
may the dashboards continue to grow, wisely, stretching for new ecologies and ethnographies of practice
thank you for being the ants and worms, with your intentional eyes, hearts, clicks....

[* timely]
The following is excerpted from a draft manuscript by [Tom Atlee](https://www.co-intelligence.institute/tom-atlee), in the next 2 weeks being finalized for publication (mid-January 2024).
[sources of collective wisdom [tom atlee co-intelligence book, appendix c]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19lGrhbvFTszKe55onb0Uyngs-xPDNXhmGYj0mwuflZ4/edit)
Tom will be checking here for comments periodically, perhaps also interacting; in the meantime, this section of Tom’s upcoming book on Co-Intelligence seemed to be appropriate for consideration by anyone involved in coordinating and collaborating.
Thanks for having a look. - Charles

In a recent email highlighting indigenous voices on the metacrisis, Tom shared interviews with these stellar women:
    [Vanessa Machado de Oliveira Andreotti](https://pca.st/13q1e5t1#) (First Voices Radio 11/26/23)

... juxtaposed with a trio of uber-nerd-dudes ... weaving relevant parallels:

- [we must become custodians of noosphere before we can be custodians of the biosphere](https://youtu.be/125ihqgmicY?si=u_SqL_FobdvWx-fD&t=96)
    *"power is only destructive to the degree to which it is not met with an equal or greater degree of wisdom and we literally are gods but for the wisdom. so the problem lies not in the presence of our god-like powers but in the absence of any god-like wisdom, or more specifically the mismatch between our power and our wisdom is the very thing that gives rise to the metacrisis."*
