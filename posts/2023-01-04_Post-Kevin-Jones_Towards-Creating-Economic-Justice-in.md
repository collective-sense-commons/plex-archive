## Towards Creating Economic Justice in Your Town
by **Kevin Jones**

**Neighborhood Economics** got funding for two years, with a verbal for a third. One thing we are going to do is create a database of platforms that bridge the racial wealth gap.

There is already an existing economic justice online marketplace, but all the other platforms are new methods of delivering capital to the people who donâ€™t normally get it.

The context, there is a 10x Black to white racial wealth gap in the US. The average Black family has $14k in net assets; the average white family more than $140k.

Our db will highlight and catalogue methods of asset creation across three vectors: entrepreneurship to create intergenerational wealth, housing, and commercial real estate.

There are a variety of new and emerging equity and debt funds for the first, and financial platforms that democratize asset creation around home ownership and commercial real estate. We will be tracking those for practitioners, donors, catalytic investors, local governments, policy makers at the federal level and think tanks, analysts, and local and sector focused media.

We will partner with related initiatives once we get it up and running. We want to point to what is newly possible to create economic justice in your town, based on real and relevant examples.
