**The Spiritual Lives of Scientists** was the subtitle of the 2023 Book of the Year from Nautilus Publishing. The author, Dr. Paul Mills, recently launched an accompanying podcast, where Plex subscriber and contributor **Michael Lennon** was among the first interviewees.

The discussion ranged from techniques for catalyzing collective cognition, to Demystifying Complexity, and different ways for interrogating Mystery within and beyond Science.
