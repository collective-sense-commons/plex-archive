## <nettime>
by **Peter Kaminski**

[nettime](https://nettime.org/) is a 25-year-old Internet institution, a moderated mailing list sort of about the intersection of human culture and the Internet. There's a [short Wikipedia article about nettime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nettime), and [archives going all the way back](https://nettime.org/Lists-Archives).

(A quarter-century is a long time on the Internet, but there are even older things. I'm still on a much smaller social list that's been around since 1989; I joined in '92 or '93.)

There was recently a bit of an existential crisis, and it wasn't clear if nettime's time was up, but I'm glad to report that it's still quite alive and vital, a new team of moderators stepping in for the previous gracious hosts, and a move to a new list service. You can see some of the new signs of life in recent posts:

- [I'd say definitely-not-yet dead](https://nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-2307/msg00002.html)
- [a longform summary of the synchronous meeting held today](https://nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-2307/msg00008.html)
- [... a shortwave radio that must be 40 years old still functions. Â This discovery gave me a lot of the same moral comfort that I derive from nettime.](https://nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-2307/msg00012.html)

This isn't really a recommendation to join the list, or even read the archives, and even if you wanted to subscribe, it might be best to wait a few weeks until they transition to the new server. But I wanted to pass along a small bright spot of news and longish-term permanence on the 'net, in a sea of too much churn and change.
