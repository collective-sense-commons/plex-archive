## Beyond the Web: Cory Doctorow
by **Doc Searls**

Our next [Beyond the Web](https://ostromworkshop.indiana.edu/news-events/events/salon/index.html) salon at Indiana University’s [Ostrom Workshop](https://ostromworkshop.indiana.edu/) will feature **Cory Doctorow,** whose prolific writing and activism (most notably with the EFF) is (I submit) in an OGM-y direction.

It will happen on Monday, March 20th, at 2pm EDT, on Zoom (unless you’re in Bloomington and want to attend in meet/meat space). Here’s the page for his salon: [Ostrom Workshop: Beyond the Web Speaker Series Cory Doctorow](https://events.iu.edu/ostromworkshop/event/806592-ostrom-workshop-beyond-the-web-speaker-series-cory).

BUT, since one of the two registration buttons on that page doesn’t work yet, *here is a link that goes straight to the registration form*: [IU Zoom Meeting Registration](https://iu.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZUkduCtrjgqGdyxV37xLBfw6XCs9VM7RfnT).

Fill that out and you’ll get back a Zoom link that will make you a rectangle in the salon.

These salons are about constructive discussion, and not just a keynote-style lecture. So it’s a great way to engage with Cory and other interesting folks for up to an hour and a half. Hope to see lots of you there.
