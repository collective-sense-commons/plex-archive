## Collabathon ‘23 Update
by **Michael Grossman**

The **Collaborative Technology Alliance** is a group of makers and technologists and activists who have agreed to a set of principles set out on [collaborative.tech](https://collaborative.tech/). CTA and its members are committed to building social technology that benefits both people and planet.

CTA members include [Hylo](https://hylo.com/), [Tru.net](https://www.tru.net/), [Catalist](https://catalist.network/), [Factr](https://factr.com/), [Murmurations](https://murmurations.network/), [Massive Wiki](https://massive.wiki/), and [Noo Network](https://www.noo.network/), among others.

**[Collabathon ‘23](https://www.collaborative.tech/collabathon-23)** is a multi-week, asynchronous hackathon hosted by the Collaborative Technology Alliance, intended to spark and fund new or existing projects focused on activating cross platform interoperability and collaboration.

After the first few weeks, we're noticing that the proposals are tending to coalesce into several buckets:

- Proposals to use a platform associated with a particular maker; 
- to expand the reach and impact of the CTA; and
- to build interoperable features that all CTA members can incorporate.

The Collabathon is structured around a small pot of funds with an invitation to submit proposals and budgets to get a piece of the pie. In the process, we've realized that depending on the size of those budgets, there might only be a few winners and perhaps as many as 20 losers–many with very similar ideas, but slightly different approaches.

The review process has observed the overlap between projects, in the 1st category particularly, and is discussing how to merge and synthesize towards the 3rd approach.

Final presentations and the participatory process for deciding how much money to allocate to each project is scheduled for the end of March. Stay tuned for an update when we're farther along.
