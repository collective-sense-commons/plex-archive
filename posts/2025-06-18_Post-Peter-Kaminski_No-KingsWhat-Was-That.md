## No Kings–What Was That?
by **Peter Kaminski** and **Pete Forsyth**

On Saturday, June 14, millions of Americans and many more people around the world expressed dissatisfaction with the corruption and the authoritarian tactics of the Trump administration, in the massively distributed **“No Kings”** demonstrations. The demonstrations were held on Flag Day, in opposition to the military review parade ordered by President Trump on that day in Washington, D.C.

On the [No Kings protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=No_Kings_protests&oldid=1296282741) page, [Wikipedia contributors](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=No_Kings_protests&action=history) have written (emphasis added):

Organizers estimated that more than **five million people** participated in **more than 2,100 cities and towns,** including the flagship event in Philadelphia. More protests took place in the U.S. territories of Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, and in 20 foreign countries, including Canada, Japan, Mexico, and in Europe. In countries with constitutional monarchies such as Canada and the United Kingdom, the alternate “Dictators” or “Tyrants” titles were favored over “Kings” to avoid confusion with anti-monarchic movements; Hawaii did the same to avoid confusion with a King Kamehameha Day parade held on the same day.The No Kings organizers [hope to spark a movement](https://www.nokings.org/next): “The road ahead isn’t just about one protest or one day. It’s about building a movement powerful enough to win against authoritarian forces dead set on destroying our democracy.”

They also stress nonviolent action: “A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action. We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values and to act lawfully at these events. Weapons of any kind, including those legally permitted, should not be brought to events.”

The changes the Trump administration promulgates for the US are exceptionally broad and deep, and to many, antithetical to core values espoused by US leaders and citizens for 250 years. (For example, one huge planned change among many: dramatically defunding science, in what scientist Joshua Weitz calls[ A Catastrophic Vision of a Diminished America](https://joshuasweitz.substack.com/p/the-white-house-vision-for-dismantling).)

Being overwhelmed by depressing events is relatable and understandable, but consider that it may be time to stretch beyond what’s comfortable, either on the basis of principles, or even just personal and family self-interest. Even if you or your loved ones have yet to be affected by abrupt policy changes, staying engaged and informed remains crucial. What seems distant today may impact you sooner than you think.

Learn more. Connect more with people with whom you resonate and trust. Take action, whether big or small. Learn to trust your gut and trust your friends. Our lives and our country depend on it.
