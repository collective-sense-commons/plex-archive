## Expanding Your Peripheral Vision
by **Peter Kaminski**

We’re still in the early stages of language-enabled AI, where big companies and individuals alike are experimenting and building new things.

I recommend watching a short demo by **Marshall Kirkpatrick** on a recent **Open Global Mind Thursday** call. Marshall demonstrates an AI-powered no-code tool he created, which takes some of his key takeaways from the day’s reading, and expands outward from them to “brainstorm” new connections, concepts, and ideas. Watch for both the tool itself, and for Marshall’s approach to developing the tool, using GPT-4o in Google Sheets to do cascading processing, without any programming.

He thinks of his tool as an “advisory historian,” and a tool for “bolstering our peripheral vision.” (The idea of “expand your peripheral vision” comes from Chapter 2 of **April Rinne’s** book, [Flux: 8 Superpowers for Thriving in Constant Change](https://fluxmindset.com/).)

To see Marshall's demo, start at [0h 1m 47s in the 2024-05-23 OGM Call](https://youtu.be/uABiV2viDkQ?t=107) recording on YouTube.

Marshall discussed much more about current LLM tools and news a couple weeks before; for that, start at [0h 3m 19s in the 2024-05-09 OGM Call](https://youtu.be/KbyGhM8aG4o?t=199) recording on YouTube.
