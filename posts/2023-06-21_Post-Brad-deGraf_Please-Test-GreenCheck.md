## Please Test GreenCheck
by **Brad DeGraf, Charles Blass, Collaborative Technology Alliance**

[GreenCheck](https://greencheck.world/) is a simple, cooperative approach to trust, identity, and community. It is a **by-invitation mutual validation network**, to be formalized as a ***[network cooperative](https://greencheck.world/about?index=6)***. GreenCheck is an initiative of [NAO.is](https://nao.is/) in collaboration with the [Collaborative Technology Alliance](https://www.collaborative.tech/), [JLinc](https://www.jlinc.com/), and others.

GreenCheck makes it easy for each of us to assert *proof of personhood* (uniqueness in the GreenCheck registry), and to validate each otherâ€™s assertions (aka **three-friend authentication**).

That uniqueness solves a [lot of problems](https://greencheck.world/about?index=3) and makes important things like [People Discovery](https://greencheck.world/about?index=7), [Networks of Trust](https://greencheck.world/about?index=7), and [Portable Communities](https://greencheck.world/about?index=5) possible.

It's at a good MVP plateau, so please try out [GreenCheck](https://greencheck.world/). Claim as many accounts as you can (Linkedin, Twitter, Github, Mastodon, Youtube, ...). Then find someone to Praise and do so. Also Validate others you know who have claimed at least two accounts.

Check out the [Timeline to see latest activity](https://greencheck.world/timeline) including your own.

There are some short videos that will help speed things up. Also a couple of [known issues](https://greencheck.world/about?index=11).

Medium term plan is to integrate with Federated Authentication Network to map your GC node that has been validated to a DID that can then be used as your presence in Portable Communities.

Please comment in the [Please Test GreenCheck Hylo thread](https://www.hylo.com/groups/collaborative-technology-alliance/post/61553) if you can, or email [Charles Blass](mailto:cb@lovevolv.org) with any critiques, questions, bugs.
