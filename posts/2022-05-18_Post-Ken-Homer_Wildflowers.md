## Wildflowers
by **Ken Homer**

Something different: here are a few pix of an amazing event that took place in 2009. An office park hydroseeded 5 acres of wildflowers. There were literally hundreds of thousands of flowers everywhere you looked. I spent hours walking among them. And I can attest that being around that many flowers had a profound and positive effect on my psyche. I wish they would do it again, but instead they landscaped the place with different plants. Too bad, it was quite a trip! I did make a screensaver from a bunch of these and one day I was doing a presentation on a 15â€™ screen. I forgot the screensaver was on I left a slide up for a long time when it kicked in and people were like: Whoa! Where is that?!
