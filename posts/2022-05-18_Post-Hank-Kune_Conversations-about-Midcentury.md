## Conversations about Midcentury
by **Hank Kune**

What are the futures people really want – and are committed to work towards? These days there is a lot of talk about this, and about how can we bring the diverse perspectives together – and especially the ideas of the ‘unheard third’ of society – our elders (so often consigned to mere grandparenting after retiring from professional work) and young people (rarely paid attention to by society’s decision-makers, at least until they reach the age to vote).

During the first week of June, **Time’s Arrow & Future Voices** will initiate a multigenerational dialogue about climate change, the environment, and what people want the world to be like at Midcentury.

During the week of activities around **Stockholm+50** and **World Environment Day** (2nd – 5th June) several dinners and dedicated sessions on these themes will be held, and the results of these sessions – combined with the output of the [Future Voices](https://en.framtidensroster.org/) program and other related workshops – will be presented on World Environment Day, June 5th.

Our intention is to use this ‘moment’ to launch a series of intergenerational dialogues during the coming year, leading up an apotheosis (of sorts) on World Environmental Day in June 2023: **“Conversations about Midcentury”** and the world we want to live in.

These activities will help people structure their thinking – and feelings – and visualize possibilities for different sustainable futures. Using the **Positive Cartography** methodology – combining interactive media and visual thinking – participants will experience and explain their own preferred futures.

The intention is to help people – young and old – become aware of the possibilities for and power of working together. Become aware of what they really want, and commit to work towards achieving it.

**Conversations about Midcentury** is about people in different countries and continents thinking and working together. It’s about **children dreaming the world and elders dreaming the future,** and empowering young and old to realize their dreams.

Ideally, an orchestrated set of activities (both national and international), integrating an immersive scenario-experience, (digital) storytelling, and Positive Cartography.

**Conversations** will explore the perspectives of old and young on sustainable future societies and cities, addressing climate change, redefining elderhood and eliminating ageism, listening to people’s voices & choices, and the development of intergenerational solidarity as called for in UN Secretary-General Guterres’ 2021 report [Our Common Agenda](https://www.un.org/en/content/common-agenda-report/) (un.org).

Please support us with your ideas, critical thinking, passion and expertise.
