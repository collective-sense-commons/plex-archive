## NeoBook: Bioregions and Food Systems
by **Peter Kaminski**

The project formerly known as SenseDoing and Marley has a new name, **â€œNeoBook". ** The NeoBook project is still focused in the short time on creating a first neobook on bioregions and food systems, and will expand after that.

One of the drafts of the work by **Klaus Mager** is being adapted as a Sunday school play for lower elementary school-age kids and other members of a church in Kansas. The subject of the book, caring for the Earth, fits into their Sunday school curriculum. The adaptation is a great confirmatory example of the repurposability of the components of a Neobook.

NeoBook calls are on Mondays. For more information and discussion about NeoBooks or the topic of bioregions and food systems, visit the [NeoBook channel on CSC Mattermost](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/ogm-sensedoing).
