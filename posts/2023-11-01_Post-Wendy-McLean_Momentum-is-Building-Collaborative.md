## Momentum is Building | Collaborative Ecosystem
by **Wendy McLean**

I have found that the serendipities and opportunities are coming in with greater frequency lately.  In large contrast to the unfolding events in the world - or maybe because of them? - our work has never felt more in flow.  Friends in disperate places like Portugal, Canada and Cancun have shared the same, so I sense some bigger weavings are happening. Have you felt it?  I, for one, am hoping this momentum will carry with it some of the shifts we all talk about so often.

For my part, Vincent Arena and I are working as fast as possible to launch the digital version of the Collaborative Ecosystem Directory ([link to Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPlpxoeM=/?share_link_id=724173863971); [to pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CJKFBemIczb4VQwEWNC0gqBq6Pcop8IN/view?usp=share_link)), we are mostly finessing the UI/UX at this point. It provides groups the capability to view their participants and projects, see the synergies, gain some clarity on what's possible, create knowledge repositories and begin learning together at greater scale.  The challenges of privacy, access, design and systems thinking that are required for this project keep us on learning loops that always take longer than we'd like!  We promise, access for the Plex community is coming soon (and very likely in the next Plex!)!

Finally, a recent initiative for me is researching the idea of resonance, signals and alignment where spirituality and science intersect. I'm looking for a collaborator. If that is an interest of yours, I'd love to chat.For any questions or insights on the above, feel free to reach me at [wendy@everyoneswisdom.com](mailto:wendy@everyoneswisdom.com)
