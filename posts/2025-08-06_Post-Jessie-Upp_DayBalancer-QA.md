## DayBalancer Q&A
by **Jessie Upp**

*[Ed. note: Jessie’s building an awesome community over at DayBalancer. I sent her some questions to help Plex readers learn more about what she’s building and why. Here are Jessie’s gracious answers. – Pete]*

***What are you working to accomplish with DayBalancer?***

We’re building a **circular talent network** that connects professionals with meaningful work opportunities - whether that meaning comes from social impact, personal mastery, community connection, or economic contribution. Instead of endless job applications, we create a peer-to-peer ecosystem where compatible opportunities find you based on your values, skills, and preferences.

Our long-term vision is to become a **member-owned cooperative**, where the community has democratic governance and shared ownership of the platform itself.

***What’s your status right now?***

**Early stage with proven concept.** We have 400 professionals in our free network and successful case studies from Seattle Tech Week and Climate Week events (hundreds of participants). We’re transitioning from free pilot testing to our first paying customers.

***What’s your business model? Current runway? Plan to extend runway?***

SaaS platform with these revenue streams:

- Event networking services: $8/person for speed networking at conferences and events
- Community platform branding: $99-$3,000/month for professionals wanting branded network visualizations
- Community data visualization and analytics services

**Free for:** Job seekers, job posters, recruiters (no placement fees or revenue sharing)
**Current runway:** Bootstrap funded, need customers immediately for sustainability

***What’s your social good model?***

We address **systemic barriers** in hiring (marginalization, ageism, racism, sexism, ableism, classism) through our peer-to-peer network. Instead of single-point-of-failure employment, we create **multiple value exchange pathways** so one disruption doesn’t destroy someone’s stability.Our cooperative-building structure ensures value flows to community members rather than external shareholders.

***What resources are you looking for?***

- Event producers and community leaders ready to pilot our services
- Sales and business development support
- Future cooperative members once we establish revenue
- Pilot testing partners for our premium features
