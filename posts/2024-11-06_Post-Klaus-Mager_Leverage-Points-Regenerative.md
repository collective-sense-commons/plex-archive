## Leverage Points: Regenerative Agriculture and Ultra-Processed Food Industry
by **Klaus Mager**

In view of our recent OGM conversation regarding climate change denial and its implications, my next newsletter is focused on finding leverage points to enter these highly controlled markets in the food sector of the economy, arguably a keystone sector that deserves more focus. As the reality of a changing environment is becoming more obvious, and the risks to the supply chain is increasing, there is now a window of opportunity opening up to support change.

The newsletter also shows the amazing power of a well-trained GPT specialist to support strategy, and conduct research with blinding speed. The challenge now is what I call ‘operationalizing’ our ideas and insights, looking for traction and scale to overcome the inertia of legacy systems that are very slow and reluctant to change.
