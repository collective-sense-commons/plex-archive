## The Meta Project Week 4
by **Jordan Sukut**

**The Meta Project** has advanced into Week 4 of the first six week cycle. After focusing on 1) highest intention 2) analyzing / mapping where we are, and 3) discovering what is missing...

...this week we are moving into a week of navigating / planning what is next. 
A milestone to celebrate is that we have more than enough energy to carry us forward into the next 6 week cycle, and dozens of more connections and possibilities emerged the last couple weeks at a larger scale than we imagined.

After embracing all the discovery, we will now be working towards converging and exploring how to best coordinate / align / federate the various circles, organizations, working groups, projects etc. that are heading in the same direction. 
Exciting times, thank you for following along! If you would like to get involved in the next 6 week cycle please reach out to [Pete](mailto:kaminski@istori.com) or [Jordan](mailto:j@lionsberg.org) and we will get you connected.

The **Meta Project Navigation, 2022-04-27 call,** among other things, had a remarkable energy shift in the middle. We had not yet started the convention of notifying participants that the recording would be published into the commons, so the recording is unlisted. Contact [Pete](mailto:kaminski@istori.com) or [Jordan](mailto:j@lionsberg.org) and for the link.

The **Meta Project Navigation, 2022-05-04 call** can be viewed at YouTube via Pete's [Meta Project playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLADGyQqAcmioZVw88tP3pPG_5z_aNKmwP).
