## Meta Project Continues to Unfold
**Jordan Sukut** and the rest of the Lionsberg/Meta Project crew had their second Community Meeting today. It was dynamic and rich. Jordan was moved to write afterwards:

A few people were feeling overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude / energy / brilliance revealed in the room today… I want to name this emotion… and the fear / awe it can inspire… and invite us to rest in that, all of us who are feeling overwhelmed by the immensity of what we are seeing might be possible and how it might affect us… and the fear of how it might overwhelm us… We are all in this together. Let us be courageous and face into the fear and overwhelm… we might discover that what we are regarding with apprehension is actually the seeds of what might eventually save us from what we fear could overwhelm us. It is the extraordinary paradox of coming face to face with something of immense potential. Much love - I hope that is more helpful than confusing… just wanting to name a sense that is present or emergent, and encourage us to carefully and courageously attend to it these coming days…With immense love, gratitude, and respect, in community,~ JCatch up with the **#MetaProject** in the [[Lionsberg] Town Square](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/lionsberg-town-square) channel on CSC Mattermost and on their regular Community Meetings on Wednesdays. Also watch for more about their new “[Request For Guidance](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/lionsberg-requests-for-guidance)” action/process.
