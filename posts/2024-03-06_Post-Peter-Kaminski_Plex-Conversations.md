## Plex Conversations
by **Peter Kaminski**

I am continuing a practice of having one-on-one conversations with members of the Plex intercommunities, with the goal of helping us all know each other better, and to think better together.

I invite you to also have a conversation with another person, inside or outside of the Plex, and to share the best parts of that conversation with all of us. Send me an email at [kaminski@istori.com](mailto:kaminski@istori.com).

Here is a conversation with Doug Carmichael.
