## Shifting My Participation
by **Jerry Michalski**

It's taken me a long time to figure out just how distractable I am. Every time I'm in one of our calls, I end up with a bunch of open tabs to read and curate and my brain(s) spinning, then I look up and suddenly it's dinner time.

So very recently, in order to achieve more of my goals (which include booking a steady flow of keynote talks, writing a NeoBook or three, and getting more of the ideas in my head into the world openly) I decided to step back from some of the standing calls that I host every week.

I'll still be on the OGM call on Thursdays, but I've handed the other calls over to regular participants to rename, reschedule, fold down or keep going as is — whatever you'd like to do. This has been harder to do than I realized. I love you all and am quite attached to our conversations.

If you follow me on [Substack](https://rethinkconstraints.substack.com/) or [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jerrymichalski), you may actually see more of me, because I'll be there more, trying to describe and create the elements of an Open Global Mind 🌍🧠😁.
