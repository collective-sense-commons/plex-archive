## Building Bioregional Intelligence: Watershed Wisdom
by **Michael Lennon**

There are a series of virtual community action learning-type events running throughout the summer. A group of us with an interest in “*attuning into greater self-assembly / cognition*” are exploring using one or more of these events to engage in an learning sprint oriented around “*building the relational soil for greater collective intelligence.*”

Other possible labels for the learning venture are: “*Building Bioregional Intelligence (Watershed Wisdom)*” or “*Care as the driver of greater intelligence.*”

Upcoming community virtual events targeted include the following:

**Co-creating a World that Works for All**, June 27-July 25, [http://bit.ly/wtwfareg](http://bit.ly/wtwfareg)

- Ben Roberts' summit on using Open Space Technology and Kumu.
- Basic approach: crowdsource the identification of hot topics, actors, levels of shared interest, and represent these on a social graph to facilitate foraging for and self-organizing into venturing clusters.

**GreaterThan Jamboree,** [https://www.greaterthan.works/events#solstice-jamboree](https://www.greaterthan.works/events#solstice-jamboree)

- Learning Event with 6 low cost sessions designed to accelerate activist self-assembly. 

**Visualising the Field of Systems Practice, School of Systems Change**

- SSC curated and built a social graph / affinity network of systems change practitioners and organisations that are connected by terms related to systems change practice. The categories and names are curated by SSC.

Note that the events above are open to all.  

There are additional similar events and opportunities where *Team Building Bioregional Intelligence* may participate as an "action research/action learning" group.
