## Massive Wiki Dev Update
by **Bill Anderson**

**[Massive Wiki](https://massive.wiki/)** development continues at a steady, one step at a time, pace. Pete and Bill have been pair-programming (old-school) and working on two fronts:
(1) make using the MW model easier for first-time participants; and
(2) improve a basic design and features of a MW website.

Work on (1) has yielded an architecture that separates technologies supporting sharing from those supporting version control. One goal for this work is to provide a simple procedure for getting new participants up and running a MW on their own computers and sharing it with others. Providing an operational model for users **and **hiding the plumbing is interesting design and deployment work.

Work on (2) is providing a sidebar on the wiki web pages and ensuring that all wiki links point to existing web pages (i.e., no more 404s). Next steps on the website include search, separate home-page template, and providing a link to the most recent changed wiki pages.

The Massive Wiki team welcomes you to drop by the [Massive Wiki chat channel](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/massive-wiki) on CSC Mattermost, or the weekly Massive Wiki Wednesday zoom call, 9am PDT, 12pm EDT, 4pm UTC (during Daylight Savings), zoom link in the chat channel.
