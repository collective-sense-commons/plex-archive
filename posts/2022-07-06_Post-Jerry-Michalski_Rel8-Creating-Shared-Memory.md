## Rel8 - Creating Shared Memory
*[Rel8](https://rel8.dev/) is a new focused project by [Jerry Michalski](http://jerrymichalski.com/). The following was ripped from the [Rel8 Wiki](https://wiki.rel8.dev/), hot off the keyboard. Â Rel8 is a work in progress; you are welcome to join in.*

Rel8 is born from two questions:

- Why is it so difficult for us to share our notes?
- Why don't we know what we know collectively?

At the very personal scale, plenty of individuals are perfecting their note-taking, but usually those notes are just for themselves. The rest of us are often duplicating those efforts and not benefiting from the possibilities of a hive mind.

At the larger organizational scale, plenty of companies and nonprofits are [tktk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_come_(publishing))...

Rel8 is a shepherding and stewarding project, not a coding project to build yet another platform.

Rel8 is figuring out what conditions, organizations and dynamics need to exist so we can create a shared memory. This mission requires:

- Convening solution-finding conversations
- Creating prototype code and use cases to illustrate what's possible and why

What Are We Doing Now?

- Improving [the wiki](https://wiki.rel8.dev/).
- Holding **office hours** (to build the wiki)
