## Chronicles of Change
### Collapse, Resilience, and Humanity's Path Forward
by **Ken Homer** and **Peter Kaminski**

**Chronicles of Change** is a reading list of books assembled by Ken Homer and Peter Kaminski. The books in the list discuss the collapse of societies, as well as insights into how societies adapt, transform, or reinvent themselves in the face of challenges. There are currently 55 books in the list, including **The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire** by Edward Gibbon; and a two-volume abridgement by David Churchill Somervell of Toynbee's **A Study of History,** both mentioned by Doug Carmichael elsewhere in this issue.

**Chronicles of Change** was created to be a resource for the August 24th OGM call, which will be on the topic of the collapse and reinvention of societies, and also as a longer-term contribution to knowledge and understanding of collapse and resilience. The list is published under CC0 and dedicated into the public domain.
