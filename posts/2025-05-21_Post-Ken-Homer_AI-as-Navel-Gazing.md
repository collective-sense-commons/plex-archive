## AI as Navel Gazing
by **Ken Homer**

On a recent OGM call I posed this prompt to ChatGPT: “Please write a poem entitled, AI As the Ultimate in Navel Gazing. Write it from the perspective of how humans look at AI as if it is a newly created living breathing child made in our own image.” Find its poem [here](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/pl/jmqefu6uopghfpysdxda739f8o).

I was amused by CGPT’s reply but also disappointed as it didn’t go where I had hoped it might. So, I posed the same prompt to myself. Below is my version. Note: I don’t usually compose with rhyming couplets, but since CGPT’s poem used that form, I did as well.

### AI As the Ultimate in Navel Gazing
Embedded in the code of AI is the assumption that Gaia exists for human exploitation
But Modernity’s dream of infinite progress demands the worst kind of amputation
The Children of Modernity have severed their intellectual lives from Gaia’s nature
They pin their hopes for the future on a cloudy machine using indeterminate nomenclature

AI represents the apex of the centuries long arc that traces Earth/Human separation
A cloud-based repository containing vast amounts of data and questionable information

Like monotheism’s omnipotent god, AI is everywhere at once but oh so hard to see
AI’s bright shiny distractions cloak its founder’s sinister deeds and motives in invisibility

Those who are able, spend vast sums of money on AI's rapid development
But their tent, like that of the Bishop’s, is pitched in a place of [excrement](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43295/crazy-jane-talks-with-the-bishop)
There’re billions of dollars to be made by those who occupy the seats of power
AI maps every bit of Gaia’s mass so corporations can rape and drill and plough her

AI holds out the tantalizing promise of intelligence beyond measure
A brilliant tool to solve every problem also offers up new pleasures
AI as it exists today is the fever dream of a bunch of puer aeterni––the naivest males of all
If Humanity surrenders its agency to their dream all life is headed for a terrible fall

AI’s ability to reason is awesome but it has no heart inside
Where in AI’s binary circuits does true wisdom reside?
No breath flows within AI that is shared with the rest of life
It has no limbic system either that can attune it to life’s suffering and strife

AI will never stand on a mountain top, swim in the ocean, or climb a tree
It can’t be cut, it’ll never bleed, see a sunset, or bounce a baby on its knee
It’ll never feel the joy of love or the pain of loss when your lover is gone
It’ll never really be your friend it’s not actually something you can count on

AI is purely rational it has no emotions to cloud its thinking
Sucking dry reservoirs or restarting Three Mile Island––it does so without blinking
“What could possibly go wrong?” is a question these days rarely posed
Methinks the hype around AI will mean the whole planet gets hosed

Trained on old dead white guys, Facebook, and TikTok, AI’s education is not well-rounded
AI is located in the cloud, if it were a person we’d declare that they’re ungrounded
We think that AI will become conscious through improved speed and calculation
Through its hardwired assumptions AI reinforces the illusion of subject-object separation

AI’s the 21st Century’s Gold Rush – hurry up and get onboard
Just clone yourself with an AI bot and show folks how you have scored
But the AI available to you and me is nothing more than a convenient ruse
Behind the scenes of the military’s industrial machine we’re all being screwed

AI’s a matter of National Security these days as those in charge in Washington all tell us
Intelligent weapons systems are the dreams defense contractors want to sell us
Like fully automated self-driving cars AI will no doubt create some major crashes
But don’t look for who’s responsible because the vendors will have covered their asses

Look thru the wrong end of the telescope and what’s close seems far away
AI looms large in pop culture while the metacrisis is denied and held at bay
The bio-intelligence of Gaia, the neuro-net that brings life – including you and me – alive
Is unseated by human’s narcissistic obsession with AI and extinction shifts into overdrive

Can AI really help us to avert what surely seems like a terribly tragic fate?
With so much shit hitting the fan, can us-humans act effectively before it’s too late?
If AI were trained up on wisdom and patience and not merely on rationality
We just might see some progress occur in combatting venality

You probably think that this poet totally rejects AI but you might be surprised
To learn I’m not against the tool, I’m against AI as savior, against AI being canonized
As a tool to reveal our biases AI could be quite a boon, a friendly helping hand
But to look the other way as AI exacerbates inequalities is a headlong rush into quicksand

There’s no doubt AI has a part to play in whatever future us-humans create
It’d be reassuring to know that it can help us through some of our dire straits
Orienting AI to be in the [service of life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1Rc_codNVA) might prove to be salubrious
But guided by Bezos, Musk, and Zuck, the future for AI and Gaia looks highly dubious

Methinks of AI as the ultimate in navel-gazing – a truly narcissistic exercise
A pleasant way to distract ourselves from fouled water, land, and sky
AI offers the illusion that it will set everything to right
But the ways it’s being used today cause me to lie awake uneasy in the dead of night
