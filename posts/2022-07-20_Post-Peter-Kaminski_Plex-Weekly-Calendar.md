## Plex Weekly Calendar
We've developed a community calendar, with a number of weekly and other regular calls you may wish to attend. It doesn't show dates; rather, it shows days of the week.

To find the calendar in the future, please bookmark this permalink: [Plex Calendar](__GHOST_URL__/calendar/).

To see the calendar now, view it in Google Sheets:

*[Image not included in the current archive. Images may be included in the future.]*

There are a few timezones listed to the left, and in each cell there is a number from 0 to 23. That's the hour in 24-hour (computer, military) time; if the number is more than 12, subtract 12 and add “PM”. Thank you for your patience with this format; it helps keeping it up-to-date easier and more accurate.

To make it more readable, the calendar only has grids on the hour.  Calls that start or end at the half-hour or other times are stretched up and down to fit the hourly grid. For that reason, the times are approximate; find the call and check the actual schedule to make sure you attend at the right time. Double-check with the provided link or the call host anyway; the Plex calendar is supposed to be an at-a-glance overview, more than a detail-oriented time planner.

Again, to find the calendar in the future, please bookmark this permalink: [Plex Calendar](__GHOST_URL__/calendar/). Please note, the Google Sheets link is subject to change. 

Send updates and comments and suggestions on the format to [Pete](mailto:kaminski@istori.com). Thanks for checking it out!
