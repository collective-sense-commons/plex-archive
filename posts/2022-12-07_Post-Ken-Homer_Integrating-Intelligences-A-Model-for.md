## Integrating Intelligences: A Model for Sense-Making and Competence Building
by **Ken Homer**

At the forefront of contemporary science, we no longer see the universe as a machine composed of elementary building blocks. We have discovered that the material world ultimately, is a network of inseparable patterns of relationships; that the planet as a whole is a living, self-regulating system. The view of the human body as a machine and the mind as a separate entity is being replaced by one that sees not only the brain, but also the immune system, the bodily tissues, and even each cell as a living cognitive system. Evolution is no longer seen as a competitive struggle for existence, but rather a cooperative dance in which creativity and the constant emergence of novelty are the driving forces. ~ Fritjof Capra, **The Systems View of Life**

In the **Integrating Intelligences** model, people and their multiple intelligences are represented as spheres. Assumptions:

- Networks of living systems give rise to multiple intelligences.
- All boundaries are permeable.
- Some boundaries are more permeable than others.

Each intelligence has two primary functions:

- Outwardly focused – sensing and data gathering.
- Inwardly focused – sorting and synthesizing gathered data into useful information/learning.

Each intelligence extends beyond the body into the field for which it is a sensory organ. Each intelligence we have access to is a local node in a larger network of intelligences that make up the world.

### The Integrating Intelligences Model Focuses on Seven Intelligences
Some sources claim that people have access to over 20* different intelligences. We will concern ourselves with seven which relate to the effective coaching of individuals and teams. Developing each intelligence increases competence and fulfillment in life and work. Keep in mind the old saying that all models are wrong, some are more useful than others. This model offers some utility for those who are interested in applying it to development work.

**Other kinds of intelligence include: practical, musical, logic-math, motivational, etc. As the field is in its earlier stages definitions are still quite fluid. For more information, see [this listing](https://www.co-intelligence.org/multiIntelligence.html) on the co-intelligence website.*

**Spiritual Intelligence (SPQ)** is what allows us to feel connected to something larger than ourselves – for some people that might be religion, for others, it’s family, nature, community, work, etc. It is the intelligence arising from a transcendent connection. It’s the seat of our ethics, morals, and values. Spiritual Intelligence is active whenever we feel a sense of belonging and a connection to purpose.

**Cognitive Intelligence (IQ)** is usually labeled as IQ. Dealing primarily with the Executive Functions of the brain, it’s our ability to observe, make distinctions, analyze, predict, forecast, plan, categorize, and imagine. Language and computation are core elements of cognitive intelligence.

**Somatic Intelligence (SOQ)** the body isn’t just a bag of bones. It’s an exquisite evolutionary-adapted vehicle designed to move in the world with grace and power. Much of somatic intelligence is sub or unconscious such as breathing and digestion but thanks to the parasympathetic nervous system we can tap into powerful ways of knowing to guide us in our actions. Intuition is an expression of somatic intelligence.

**Emotional Intelligence (EQ)** is what allows us to cope with the moods and emotions of ourselves and others. Moods are closely related to emotions but are longer lasting. An analogy is that moods are to climate what emotions are to weather. Moods are predispositions for action. If your workplace has convinced you that your efforts are in vain, your mood is likely to be one of resignation where company exhortations for “continuous learning and improvement” will fall on deaf ears. Intentionally cultivating positive emotions and moods can be enormously powerful in shifting how much meaning, enjoyment, and satisfaction we derive from life, even in the midst of turmoil.

**Social (Relational) Intelligence (SRQ)** is our ability to read a room, to reach out, initiate, nourish, and sustain mutually rewarding relationships. Critical to developing Collective Intelligence, SRQ is responsible for our social perceptiveness and understanding how we are relating to and supporting others – or failing to do so. Listening, communicating empathically, establishing trust, developing respect, all lie in the domain of Social Intelligence.

**Integrating Intelligence (IIQ)** is how well we are able to develop and apply all the intelligences listed above to take effective actions, make useful contributions, create a sense of accomplishment, build community, and live a meaningful life.

**Embodied Intelligence (EBQ)** is closely related to integrating intelligence, but it differs slightly because it refers to those intelligences we can apply in any given moment – something that changes constantly depending on a multitude of factors both internal and external.

Notice in the above diagram that the outer heavy dotted line that almost encompasses all the intelligences represents the totality of a person while embodied intelligence is much smaller. Think of the outer circle as the potential of a person and the embodied circle as what is available in the moment. Our potential always exceeds what is available for us to embody in the moment.

All these intelligences are different aspects of unified whole. They are closely coupled and intertwined; there are no hard lines of division between them. Each serves different functions. The distinctions offered in this model provide a coaching lens that’s useful in evaluating how a client is oriented to different domains of their life and work and offers pathways for increasing the competencies of each intelligence.
