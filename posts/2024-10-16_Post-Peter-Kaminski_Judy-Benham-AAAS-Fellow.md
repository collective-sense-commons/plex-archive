## Judy Benham, AAAS Fellow!
by **Peter Kaminski**

Our own Judy Benham was recently named a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), for “contributions in advancing chemistry through new polymers and technology, leadership in innovation in science and science communities, and support of inclusive culture in science.”

The ARCS Foundation wrote about Judy and her accomplishments in [The Right Chemistry for Leadership in Science](https://www.arcsfoundation.org/news/right-chemistry-leadership-science).

Congratulations, Judy!

In correspondence, Judy also offers these two science reads that may interest Plex readers:

[The State of U.S. Science and Engineering 2024](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20243) (National Science Foundation) – *lengthy, but rich in info for those who’d be interested.*

[Volunteer Statistics 2024: How Charitable Are We With Our Time?](https://donorbox.org/nonprofit-blog/volunteer-statistics-2024) (donorbox Blog) – *on changing patterns of volunteerism, & implications.*
