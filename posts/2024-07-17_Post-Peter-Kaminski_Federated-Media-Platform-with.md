## Federated Media Platform with Neighborhood Economics 
by **Peter Kaminski**

**Kevin Jones** of [Neighborhood Economics](https://neighborhoodeconomics.org/) has been talking with **Joel Skene** of [Mindful Marketplace](https://www.mindfulmarketplaceshow.com/) and **Michael Shuman** of [Main Street Journal](https://www.themainstreetjournal.org/) to explore a partnership to create a federated media platform.

In the discussion, Mindful Marketplace would focus on audio and video content, including podcasts featuring experts in the field. Main Street Journal would serve as the primary archive for written content, leveraging its high readership and content management to maximize exposure. Neighborhood Economics would contribute its media assets. Kevin is currently writing for the Neighborhood Economics newsletter and also for his blog about Neberecon’s partnership with Eagle on the CataCap platform.

Kevin says, “Two players have media platforms. We don’t. We have an events platform and a regular newsletter. I’m suggesting we imagine ourselves part of a federated media platform that together will clarify the field and make investing locally in every neighborhood easier and more possible.”

The initiative is still in its early stages, but it represents an exciting step forward in the world of community-focused economic development.
