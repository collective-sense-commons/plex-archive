## Open Global Mind, April 10th, 2025
### The Tariff Rollercoaster
*I posted about the March 27th OGM call in *[*Plex: 2 April 2025*](__GHOST_URL__/2025-04-02/)* because I thought it was a great call and wanted to share.*

*For the April 10th call, I wouldn’t call it a must-watch, but I’m using a new set of prompts and process to create meeting summaries with AI, and I think this came out great, and I wanted to publish it as sort of a test. Gemini wrote the summary. I’ve reviewed it carefully and take editorial responsibility for publishing it here.*

*What do you think, is this useful? Or is it an affront, because it's synthesized by an AI? Please *[*let me know*](mailto:kaminski@istori.com)* what you think. –Pete*

Here's the call in Jerry's Brain: [2025-04-10 OGM Call](https://bra.in/6pDg3n).

*This document prepared on April 11, 2025 by Gemini Advanced 2.5 Pro (experimental), prompted by Peter Kaminski, using as inputs the Zoom Otter VTT transcript, a Whisper Large v2 transcript generated by Pete, and the chat transcript. It was prepared by an AI from transcripts, and should be useful and generally correct, but it may contain errors.*

**Meeting Summary**

The meeting began with acknowledgments of the current volatile economic climate, referred to as the “tariff roller coaster”, and touched upon the significant market fluctuations and potential insider trading scandals compared to Teapot Dome. Participants discussed the dynamics of the stock market drops, noting that selling requires buyers and questioning who benefits from these shifts. Early chat discussion mirrored this uncertainty, debating the safety of investments like CDs and money market funds, suggesting barter as an alternative. Concerns were raised about geopolitical instability, particularly potential conflicts involving the US, Iran, and China. Klaus Mager shared specific details in the chat about US military deployments (B-2 bombers, carrier groups) aimed at Iran while this risk was being discussed verbally. The dependency on China for rare earth minerals and the potential impact of China cutting off access were highlighted, with Pete Kaminski noting in the chat that China’s control of strategic metals was achieved with surgical precision, contrasting it with the “bull in a china shop” tariff approach.

The core of the discussion revolved around analyzing the Trump administration’s actions, primarily the tariff policies. Various perspectives emerged: some viewed the actions as part of a deliberate, strategic plan (potentially influenced by figures like Steve Bannon, whose explicit views were mentioned in chat) to dismantle the post-WWII global order (Pax Americana), while others saw them as chaotic, incompetent, or driven by childlike impulses. Chat commentary referred to Trump’s strategy as potentially from “The Art of the Deal” or simply “Policy cosplay”. Pete Kaminski viewed it as a dismantling of Pax Americana, possibly orchestrated by others using Trump as a “wrecking machine”. Gil Friend echoed this in the chat, asking Pete who he thought was behind the dismantling and sharing his analytical touchstones: “Follow the money” and “Who benefits”. The potential role of cryptocurrency in potential conflicts of interest and anonymous payments was explored, with Mike Nelson sharing a link in the chat detailing alleged Trump crypto grifts.

Klaus Mager drew historical parallels to demagogues backed by industrialists, suggesting Project 2025 outlines the current agenda driven by elites seeking deregulation. Dave Gray offered a contrasting view, suggesting tariffs and border controls, despite implementation issues due to inconsistency, could strategically benefit American workers, reduce inequality, and foster self-sufficiency – a perspective met with skepticism. Chat participants noted the difficulty of finding American workers for many essential jobs, and Mike Nelson provided a specific example via chat of how removing the “$800 de minimus” exemption harms poorer Americans buying cheap goods online. Jerry Michalski drew parallels between the tariff situation and the 2008 financial crisis (GFC, clarified in chat), suggesting it might be a large-scale financial scheme. Gil Friend shared extensive quotes and a link from Epsilon Theory via chat, elaborating on the view that the administration seeks to replace Pax Americana with a competitive “America First” regime based on bilateral deals, viewing this as a mistake leading to a worse outcome for everyone.

Towards the conclusion, the conversation shifted towards constructive responses. Participants emphasized the importance and potential of local action, community organizing, and leveraging tools like AI to build resilience and bypass federal dysfunction. Gil Friend noted state/local government initiatives stepping into the federal gap, though he also mentioned via chat that the administration is challenging state powers. The potential for regenerative development was mentioned. Chat discussion touched on the Mondragon cooperative and Kim Stanley Robinson’s sci-fi depiction of its evolution. Ken Homer concluded with a reading of Naomi Shahib Nye’s poem “Kindness”, after suggesting in chat a focus on ethics (valuing others) over morality (external rules). The topic for the next call was set to focus on positive actions and opportunities emerging from the current challenges.

**Action Items**

- **Anyone:** Find and post the video clip of the US Trade Representative being contradicted by Trump during a hearing to the chat/list (Link posted by Mike Nelson in chat).  
- **Mike Nelson:** Share information/essays by Dean Ball regarding AI regulation and governance (Links posted in chat).  
- **Ken Homer:** Post the poem “Kindness” by Naomi Shahib Nye to the group’s list.  
- **Jerry Michalski / Group:** Prepare for the next meeting focused on the topic: “What are the positive things we might do?” / “What opportunities open up here in the midst of the chaos?”.

**Meeting Assessment**

The overall sentiment of the meeting was one of significant concern and critical analysis regarding the current political and economic landscape, particularly US administration policies and their global repercussions. The spoken conversation and chat logs both reflected a strong sense of uncertainty and apprehension (“all bets are off”, “terrible mistake”). Descriptions of leadership (“children”, “man-child”), policy implementation (“meat axes and chain saws” vs “scalpel”), and motives (“grifting”, “Too much testosterone!”) conveyed a worried, critical tone.

The chat actively paralleled and supplemented the spoken discussion. It provided specific data points (military movements, tariff exemption details), reinforcing links and resources (Epsilon Theory, crypto grifts, Dean Ball, Cory Doctorow), and quick counterpoints or questions (Gil questioning Dave on inequality). This indicates high engagement beyond the main speakers.

Several key issues remained unresolved:

- There was no consensus on the underlying drivers of current events – whether they represent a coherent (though potentially destructive) strategy, incompetence, chaos, or manipulation by unseen actors.  
- The question “who benefits?” was explored extensively verbally and in chat but lacks a definitive answer, though chat pointed towards oligarchs, specific industries (fossil fuels), and potentially Putin.  
- Dave Gray’s argument regarding the potential positive impact of tariffs on income inequality was left hanging after his departure.  
- Mike Nelson’s potential “rosy scenarios” were mentioned but not elaborated upon.

Despite the heavy focus on problems, the chat contributions on local experiments, Kim Stanley Robinson’s future visions, and the distinction between ethics and morality amplified the meeting’s constructive conclusion. The focus shifted towards local action, resilience, and identifying positive pathways forward, setting a clear, more hopeful (or at least “curious”) direction for the subsequent meeting.
