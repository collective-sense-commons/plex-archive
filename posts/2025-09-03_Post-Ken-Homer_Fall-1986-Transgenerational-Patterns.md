## Fall 1986 - Transgenerational Patterns
by **Ken Homer**

My dad was 42 when I was born, and his dad was 42 when he was born
Family lore has it that my grandmother was cold and distant towards my dad.
Harsher behaviors were hinted at but never confirmed
He may have been an “oopsie!” what is known, is that he was not very much wanted
All my dad’s siblings were ten to 15 years older than he was
So, all my first cousins were 18 to 30 years older than me
Agewise, they were more akin to aunts and uncles than to cousins
Most of them had kids around my age

My dad had an alcohol problem–a big one–he came by it honestly
Although “honestly” and “an alcohol problem” seems an odd juxtaposition
His dad had the same problem
And his father before him
And all their brothers
And all my male cousins on my dad’s side
All of them succumbed to the allure of ethanol
The dispiritedness that runs so deep in my paternal line
Sent each of them to seek comfort in distilled spirits
Alas, it proved a fruitless search for it wasn’t the balm for their souls they sought
Instead of healing them, their drinking destroyed their lives and livelihoods
With a considerable amount of collateral damage done to their families

In 1986, when my dad lay dying, a cousin of mine told me a story about him
The story takes place in December in 1953 a few years before I was born
My dad was in his late thirties at the time and fully in the thrall of alcohol
My cousin said that my dad was at a bar, and he knew he was too drunk to drive
He was due at my aunt’s house, so, he called my cousin and asked him for a ride
My cousin obliges and picks up my dad who gets into my cousin’s car
He told me that my dad was drunk but coherent and they chatted on the way home
But when they got to my aunt’s house and walked in something happened
When my aunt realized my dad was drunk, she lost it totally and flew into a rage
She started to slap my dad repeatedly across the face and she was screaming at him:

Nobody wants you here
We never wanted you
Nobody wants you
Go away!
Get out!
You don’t belong here!

When my aunt started hitting my dad my cousin said it was like a switch got thrown
My dad suddenly started to act far drunker than he’d been on the ride over
And he’s crying and sobbing and apologizing and begging her to let him stay
But my aunt keeps slapping him and shouting at him to get out
And he walks out into the cold winter night–alone

A lifelong smoker, my dad died of lung cancer–his dying process was brutal
It was horrific to see him coughing up blood as he wasted away–he lost 60 pounds
It tore my world apart to watch it unfold; I really had no idea how to handle it
Coping with it sent me down my own alcohol-drenched path in search of surcease
I was downing two six-packs a night just to be able to sleep, but it was worse for him
In his final weeks the nursing staff told me he was wrestling demons every night
He’d cry out in his sleep, yell, and sometimes sob before waking himself up

Now, I never felt unwanted growing up but there was a lot of abuse in my childhood
I always felt close with my oldest sister, but I devastated by an incredibly cruel act
On Christmas Day 1988 she invited me to come over to be with her and her kids
I assumed that meant for a few hours not for a few minutes
But after the kids had opened their presents, she told me it was time for me to leave
She told me that they wanted to have a “family Christmas dinner”
Driving home, wiping away tears, I recalled my cousin’s story about my dad
I felt a deep kinship with my father as I felt the bitter sting of being rejected by family

It was maybe two decades later that I made the connection across the generations
One day it occurred to me that my sister telling me to leave her house on Christmas
So that she could have a family Christmas dinner was a reenactment of the same
Dance that my dad and his sister took part in almost exactly 35 years earlier
Same family, different generation, same pattern, same devastating consequences
My dad was drunk I was sober–history wasn’t exactly repeating but is sure was rhyming
Somehow that realization eased the pain of both of those memories for me a little

The burden of darkness that infests the hearts of the men born into the paternal line of
My family was passed along to me without my consent and bearing it cost me dearly
There is something far bigger than one person with a drinking problem here
In generation after generation the hurt and blame are always assigned to the addict
Nobody ever looked at the family system that produced generations of alcoholics

There’s a trail of broken men with suffering wives and kids in my paternal line
All these wounded men have hurt and scarred those they loved and who loved them
A first cousin committed suicide as a result of her father’s abuse
Nobody wants to talk about that or the other things that discomfit them
Easier to stay in denial, easier to say “We don’t talk about that around here”

I’m the only one who faced the pain, got sober, and did the healing work required
But then I dared to speak up and name the hard truths that no one wanted to face
My reward was being exiled from my family rendering me powerless to intervene
I didn’t realize until long after my excommunication that that too, is a system response
So, the pattern continues unabated as my nephews discover that they are powerless
In the face of intergenerational trauma and addiction
Evolution has a dictate: learning is mandatory, survival is optional
I learned and survived my family’s illness, others were not so lucky
