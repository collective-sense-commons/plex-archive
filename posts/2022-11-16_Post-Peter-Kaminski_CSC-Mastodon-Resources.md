## CSC Mastodon Resources
by **Peter Kaminski**

As you may know, **Collective Sense Commons** is a public benefit project organized to provide coordination, communication, and sensemaking tools to individuals and organizations that are involved with collective sensemaking.

With the recent interest in [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), you might wonder, will there be a CSC Mastodon instance any time soon?

We will keep Mastodon on our long-term roadmap, but at present, there is no dearth of instances for you to choose from. CSC can save its resources for tools that are less well-represented â€“ currently [Mattermost](https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/), and we're looking at [Gitea](https://gitea.io/), and [HedgeDoc](https://hedgedoc.org/) (an open source version of HackMD) to replace our aging Etherpad server, [MeetingWords](http://meetingwords.com/).

Let's start working on a wiki page of Mastodon information - how to choose an instance, a directory of Plex people on Mastdon, and other useful information.

Use this HackMD page: [CSC Mastodon Resources](https://hackmd.io/@peterkaminski/csc-mastodon-resources/edit?both) (no sign-in required). Send me an email if you have questions or need help: [kaminski@istori.com](mailto:kaminski@istori.com).
