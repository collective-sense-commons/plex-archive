## Swannanoa Watershed and Doughnut Economics
**Kevin Jones** has been keen to bring [doughnut economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doughnut_(economic_model)) to the projects he's been working on.

Kevin writes, "The second meeting of the **Swannanoa Watershed** **doughnut economics** exploration was completed. People stayed nearly three hours to hear the permaculture farmer talk about the food shed. Two faculty women from warren wilson college's ethics and ecology department attended and will be great guides to us going forward. We are up to about a dozen people. Spending from 11-1 every monday. Going to use zoom to record it next time for us, and i will probably put it on youtube."
