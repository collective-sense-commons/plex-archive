## What We Must Do
### In the next few months
by **Douglass Carmichael**

What we must do in the next few months: Some of the pieces...

- **Cut CO2** (we have to decide where)
- **Make sure those who lose out are helped** and at least have basic security, healthy food, and shelter
- **Pay attention to energy needs.** Not freeze, not [wet-bulb death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet-bulb_temperature#Wet-bulb_temperature_and_health), cook food.
- **Try to keep stronger personalities from shifting resources** toward themselves.
- **Keep a community history** as best as you can.
- **Daily community meetings open to all** (learn to use [OPEN SPACE technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_space_technology))

What it comes down to, everything will change. Look around your room and make an assessment of the use of energy, usually heat, in the making of each one. We can assume never again.

Pay attention to history, especially related subjects such as Epicurus and his Garden school in classical Greece, to the Arts and Crafts Movement of the late 1800s. Aesthetics should guide every effort making the space attractive to work, play, and relax in.
