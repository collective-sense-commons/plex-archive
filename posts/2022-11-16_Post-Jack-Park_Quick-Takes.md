## Quick Takes
by **Jack Park**

[Editor's Note: Jack's answers to a couple of current topic questions I had asked. – Pete]

**FTX:** I think **Warren Buffet** had it right when, years ago, he didn't think crypto added value.

**Mattermost - any version:** CSC is well tended and gardened, but it's still a loooong way from what a good **Collective Intelligence** platform can be. It's totally clueless, as is Slack, about the nature of threads and truly meaty conversations (**quests**).

**Mastodon:** I joined it way back when at a supposedly “for engineers” site, but it rapidly centered on LGBT issues. No problem with that, but those issues are not on my critical path, other than supporting those at the polls.

Recently found one for academics; with their renewed interest in the platform, I'm now linking with many others, from Jerry's tribes to other groups.

I always liked the ability to say more, bookmark toots, etc. But, even there, there's room for improvement. Given the protocol - which can be easily extended - the entire Fediverse has legs, IMHO.
