## Transitioning Plex
by **Peter Kaminski**

As I wrote in [Cabbages and Kings](https://plex-archive.collectivesensecommons.org/posts/2025-09-03_post-peter-kaminski_cabbages-and-kings) in the last Plex, I’m wrapping up my biweekly involvement with Plex with this issue.

But I have good news! Kevin Jones, Scott Moehring, and John Warinner, all from the Open Global Mind community, will be taking the reins of Plex and will keep publishing Plex twice a month. Kevin is interested in hearing from you! If you’ve got something of interest, particularly about the kinds of topics OGM covers, send an [email to Kevin](mailto:kevindoylejones1@gmail.com).

New issues of Plex will continue to be published at the same web address, and subscribers will continue to receive new issues in their inbox.

For paid subscribers, thank you for supporting Plex! I very much appreciate your support, and I’m sure Kevin will appreciate it, too. Your subscription payment will be paused for a few weeks, and then you’ll have a chance to move your subscription payment over to the new Plex. The move will be “opt-in” – if you want to continue your subscription, we’ll make it easy for you to do. Or if you don’t do anything, you’ll continue with a free subscription to the new Plex.

Thanks again for being part of the Plex community!
