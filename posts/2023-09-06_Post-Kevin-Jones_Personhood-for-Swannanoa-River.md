## Personhood for Swannanoa River
by **Kevin Jones**

A capstone class from our local college environmental sciences department wants to listen in and potentially be part of the effort to gain legal status for our river, the [Swannanoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swannanoa_River), as a way to counter corporate power.

If a person hits you, they have committed a crime and can be prosecuted. Currently a river can be hit with a regulator approved level of pollution and you canâ€™t do anything.

If the river had legal status, like a corporation, it could take action against polluters, just like a person can, and stop the assault.
