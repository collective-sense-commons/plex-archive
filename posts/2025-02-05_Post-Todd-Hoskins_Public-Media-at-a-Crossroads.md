## Public Media at a Crossroads
by **Todd Hoskins**

Last month, I brought Jerry Michalski to meet with the board, commission, and staff of Maryland Public Television. Jerry offered his characteristic blend of gentle warnings while revealing his Brain visualization tool, illuminating pathways toward their future. Maryland Public Television’s journey reflects a broader transformation happening across public media—a shift from operating as independent stations toward becoming more interdependent, both with each other and their communities.

When President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act in 1967, he spoke of dedicating the airwaves “for the enlightenment of all the people.” He envisioned a future that would “enlist the computer and the satellite, as well as television and radio... in the cause of education.” Over fifty years later, his words feel remarkably prescient—and the mission remains vitally important.

I’ve spent the past five years working closely with public media stations across the country, from southern New Mexico to Michigan, from St. Louis to South Florida. I’ve also worked with national organizations like NETA that provide critical support services to these stations. In that time, I’ve met hundreds of dedicated professionals who have chosen purpose over profit, many taking significant pay cuts to work in a field that matters. These are people who believe deeply in public media’s mission to educate, inform, and strengthen our communities.

The system they serve—comprising over 1,500 independent stations across the United States and its territories—now stands at a critical crossroads. The challenges are mounting: FCC Chairman Brendan Carr has launched an investigation into NPR and PBS’s funding structures, while Senator Ted Cruz explicitly calls for defunding the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). These threats come at a time when public media’s role is more crucial than ever.

What many people might not realize is that their local public media stations operate as independent 501(c)(3) nonprofits. While PBS and NPR are household names, they primarily provide content and limited services to member stations. NPR doesn’t own its member stations, and PBS doesn’t oversee station operations or provide business management. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) supplies crucial federal funding and accountability measures, but the day-to-day operations and community engagement fall squarely on local stations themselves—and the passionate people who run them.

The media landscape has transformed dramatically since the system’s founding. Streaming services, social media, and digital platforms have fundamentally altered how we consume and interact with content. Yet public media’s role extends far beyond content delivery. In many states and local communities, public media stations’ digital and broadcast infrastructure provides the backbone for emergency alerts, public safety communications, and essential public services.

The future demands new approaches. Many stations can no longer sustain themselves through traditional independent operations. They’re exploring innovative partnerships, creative production formats that reduce costs, and deeper community collaborations. This isn’t just about survival—it’s about reimagining what public media can be. Stations are becoming true community anchors—centers for civic engagement, local journalism, and educational resources.

This transformation requires more than just financial support. Here’s how you can help:

- Engage Beyond Membership: While financial contributions remain vital, stations need advocates and participants. Attend events, join community advisory boards, and participate in local programming initiatives. Get to know the dedicated people who make public media possible in your community.
- Amplify Local Journalism: Many stations are expanding their local news coverage to fill gaps left by declining commercial media. Share their reporting, provide feedback, and help identify important community stories. And don’t stop there—support all forms of local journalism, as the future of media in your community will likely involve collaboration between public media and other local news organizations.
- Support Educational Initiatives: Public media stations often partner with schools and educational organizations. Volunteer for educational outreach programs or help connect stations with local educators. These initiatives often represent public media at its finest—directly serving community needs.
- Advocate: Stay informed about legislation affecting public broadcasting. Contact your representatives when crucial funding or policy decisions arise. The people working in public media need your voice.
- Partner: If you’re involved with local organizations, explore partnership opportunities with your station for community events, educational programs, or content creation. Public media thrives through collaboration.

The current political climate and evolving media landscape present significant challenges. However, they also offer opportunities for stations to deepen their community connections and demonstrate their essential role in civic life. I’ve seen firsthand how stations can transform when they embrace interdependence and their role as community institutions rather than just broadcasters.

Most importantly, remember that your local station exists to serve your community. Their success depends not just on funding, but on active community participation and engagement. The dedicated professionals who choose careers in public media do so because they believe in its mission. They deserve our support as they work to ensure that public media truly belongs to all people.

The future of public media will be determined not in Washington, DC, but in communities across the United States—in the daily interactions between stations and the citizens they serve. I’ve dedicated years of my life to supporting this vital institution because I believe deeply in its power to inform, educate, and unite communities. Public media has given so much to all of us; now it needs our help to face these new challenges and evolve for the future. I hope you’ll join me in protecting and strengthening this essential public resource.
