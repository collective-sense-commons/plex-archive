## On Collective Cyborg
by **George Pór**

I’ve just listened to  an inspiring podcast of Ross Dawson, [The potential of Humans plus AI](https://amplifyingcognition.com/potential-humans-plus-ai-ac-ep28/). His guests included one of my fave technosophers, Jerry Michalski. In a [forum](https://community.humansplus.ai/c/what-s-new-in-ai/humans-ai-highlights-podcast) hosted by Ross, I wrote what follows.

That was a great podcast! I loved the questions that you asked. Besides the quality of the guests’ thinking, what tells an amazing podcast apart from a mediocre one is the space from which the questions come. (After sitting through some podcasts where i was submitted to clueless hosts, I became more selective about which invitation to accept.)

I particularly resonated with Jerry Michalski’s take on your cyborg question. He said,

“**the other piece of being a better cyborg is not about being a lonely cyborg. But what does it mean to be in a collective of cyborgs?** What does it mean to be in a cyborg space? What does it mean to co-inhabit cyborg intelligence with other people and other intelligences that are just going to get faster and better at this thing?”

I guess the “collective cyborg” is what I [referred](https://community.humansplus.ai/c/future-of-ai-bcf164/the-case-for-cyborgs#comment_wrapper_32663016) to as “superorganism.” There are more and more future-responsive techno-philosophers who are interpreting current trends along those lines.

But is that enough? What if we transposed Marx’s famous quote, “**Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it,**” to our present-day context?

Extrapolating our interpretation of the current “human x AI” trend to the collective level, isn’t the point to devise ways to test the [“superorganism” hypothesis](https://community.humansplus.ai/c/future-of-ai-bcf164/the-case-for-cyborgs#comment_wrapper_32663016) with some kind of action-oriented research? I believe it is and I welcome Expressions of Interest from those colleagues who want to help in carry it forward.

P.S. Collective sense makers, who are also “big picture” thinkers and action-oriented visionaries, do need to apply.  Extra good points for having AI savvy and metamodern sensibility.
