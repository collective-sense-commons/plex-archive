## Wandering Phase
by **Kevin Jones**

I’m talking to **Dave Pollard,** author of the **Save the World** newsletter, about reproducing our **Act Local School.** 

Our market researcher with the **Give2Invest Tool** held a **Business in Color** event, sponsored by the CDC she works for, at a hip music venue. 

She said she found a lot of people who’d like to try to set up the process where they become more powerful givers because the gift comes back to be given again. I am trying to figure out my outreach strategy with it. But mostly I am wandering.

My business has cut me loose to find the next thing, and to get out of the way of the machine and replicable process that’s there to be built when you stop me reinventing it, when they need to productize it. So I am wandering.

Wondering where my heart’s greatest joy meets the world’s greatest need.

I’m attending more online webinars on things I haven’t had time to pay attention to before.

Wandering takes discipline. It’s easy to fall into going somewhere when you should keep the goal and direction without explicit outline.This is just the wandering phase, next comes truffle hound phase, when I am sure there is something here. Then raise some money and hand it off, if history repeats itself.

I am going to travel a lot less and mostly focus within a morning’s drive of the farm.
