## Earth: Final Conflict
by **Jack Park**

Amazon Prime is streaming Season 1 of “Earth: Final Conflict” (EFC), which was created by Majel Barrett Roddenberry from notes she found in Gene’s desk after he passed away. Did you know that Gene was a B-17 pilot in WWII, then flew as an airline pilot until he was involved in a [crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_Am_Flight_121)?

EFC premiered in 1997. My (now ex) wife Helen saw the show and created one of the first online fan sites, which became popular for a while. EFC features complex, twisted, and intertwined narratives: a good alien Da’an and an evil one Zo’or, both answering to the Synod and existing in a fully connected community. On the Earth side, there are good cops and “bad” cops, eventually “white nationalists,” and the usual archetypes. Majel Roddenberry appears in many scenes as a physician under the name Majel Barrett.

What surprised us is that in episode 19, we are introduced to Dr. Park (that’s all we know about her). She appears in later episodes, including Season 2. By episode 21, they are exploring white nationalism in the context of the aliens - known as Companions.

We may never know why “Dr. Park” suddenly appeared in Season 1.

We may actually learn how [Vint Cerf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf) appeared as himself in an episode where he serves as a representative of the President.

What is curious is this: the relevance of Season 1 - with all its explorations into matters greatly similar to those we face in an election year.
