## Summer 1980–Lake Toba
by **Ken Homer** (February 2024)

When I was a young man
I spent ten months traveling
In Southeast Asia and India and Nepal
I jokingly refer to that trip as my
Sex and drugs and rock and roll tour
To be completely honest
There was very little rock and roll

In those days Lake Toba
On the island of Sumatra
Was surrounded by rainforest
I’m not sure that’s true today

My lodgings were simple
A bamboo hut with thatched roof
Openings for windows with no panes
Mosquito netting over the bed
A thin mattress and pillow
A small table and a couple
Of hooks for clothes
At age 23 I could sleep
In such digs with no problem
The cost was about $5.00 a night
Which included egg fried rice for breakfast
I traveled light in those days
My backpack was only half full

Just after sunrise one morning
I set out for a long walk
Taking a trail just wide enough
For two people to pass each other so long
As they turned sideways when they met
The trail often dipped close
To the shore of the lake
Then wound inland a bit
Before returning to shore again

The sun was still low in the sky
And while warm and humid
The air temperature was pleasant

As was my habit at the time
I smoked a joint of some fine
Sumatran reefer as I walked along
It didn’t take long to feel its effects
I was soon tuned into the jungle
My footfalls nearly silent as I strode along

About an hour into my walk
I turned a corner and came
To a complete and sudden stop
To my utter shock and horror
No more six feet in front of me
Was the biggest reptile I’d ever seen

It was maybe two meters from nose to tail
Thick dark scales covered its back
With lighter markings along its underside
Its four heavily muscled legs were
Strangely reminiscent of human arms
Bent as they were at the “elbow”
Each “hand” had five long fingerlike claws

I had caught it by surprise
We gazed at each other
Measuring the frightfully short distance
That separated us
As I met its eye a line from Yeats
Flashed through my brain:
“A gaze as blank and pitiless as the Sun”
The pleasant buzz I’d been feeling
Evaporated into the tropical air
Replaced by instinctual fear
As if looking at Medusa I found myself
Completely unable to move

We stood and stared at each other
For what seemed slightly short of eternity
(It was probably less than five seconds)
It hissed at me and a forked tongue issued
Forth from its mouth that must’ve
Been at least a foot long
I think that tongue is what scared me most
This reptile was a primordial being
Utterly different from large land mammals
I felt I was confronting a dinosaur

During that short time the sounds
Of the rainforest faded from my ears
Replaced by a rushing of blood
The pounding of my heart was a roar
I had never been so close to a creature
That was so fearsome looking
And I have been face-to-face
With a bear in the Maine woods

While my brain was racing with all my
Neurons frantically working on a way out
Its brain had made a decision
Probably the same one my own brain
Would arrive at had I another
Moment to think: Run!

It moved with startling rapidity
I don’t know how it managed
To turn its long body around
In such a close space
But suddenly its arms and legs
Moved in graceful harmony with its
Powerful tail and it disappeared
From view in the blink of an eye

I was astounded at how fast it was
I was prepared to run away
I was in good shape having
Completed two marathons
In the previous year
And I figured I could outrun it
But no way would that have worked
Had it decided to charge at me

Later I realized that my camera was
Around my neck the entire time
But the thought of taking a pic
Never entered my mind

Fortunately with the help of Wikipedia
I was able to find an image
That will give you a sense
Of what I beheld on
The shores of Lake Toba that day
