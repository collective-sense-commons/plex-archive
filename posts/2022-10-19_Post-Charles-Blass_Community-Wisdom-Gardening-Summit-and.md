## Community Wisdom Gardening Summit and Pattern Jam

*RSVP:* <[http://bit.ly/wisdom-garden-summit-20221101](http://bit.ly/wisdom-garden-summit-20221101)>

we are honored to welcome a circle of visionary elders and community members to gather in the garden of ideas, histories and futures. we'll inquire into how we might co-evolve and embrace, navigate and calibrate tools and practices for continual meta-improvement, in terms of collective conversation, memory, and intersectional innovation. toward the possibility of wisdom flow.

>> hello, [charles](http://link.bar/cb) here, inviting you to an exploratory conversation, considering practical application of [doug engelbart's 'abc model',](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/192/165/) augmented with a social layer of patterns inspired by tom atlee’s work around [wholeness](https://www.co-intelligence.org/I-wholeness.html), integrating his approach to [wisdom](https://www.co-intelligence.org/wisdom.html) in the sense of the [‘prime directive of wise democracy'](https://www.wd-pl.com/prime-directive/):

*we seek to evoke and engage*
*the wisdom and resourcefulness of the whole*
*on behalf of the whole.*>> we'll be joined by esteemed guests including

[Tom Atlee](https://www.co-intelligence.institute/tom-atlee), [Howard Rheingold](https://rheingold.com/about/), [George Por](https://technoshaman.medium.com/what-is-next-transformative-communities-of-practice-51a4b58939f1) (Kernel Mentor), others TBA

plus [Kernel](https://www.kernel.community/en/) Fellows and friends in the wider ecosystem of planetary stewards,

<<<^>>>

main event is scheduled for 90 minutes. some of us will stay on in a less bounded mode after the first segment.

the session will be an opportunity to examine [doug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Engelbart)’s framework through a lens of wisdom; many groups (including kernel) are increasingly applying the metaphor of [*community garden*](https://youtu.be/koknoQSERkE?t=3923) to a group's repository at large (ie implicit repository of repositories). i suggest this is particularly apt in the special scenario of a *network aspiring to be dynamically collaborative, self-aware and self-evolving*; in engelbart parlance, within the ['bootstrapping collective IQ' landscape](https://dougengelbart.org/content/view/230/) of 'dynamic knowledge repository' ([DKR](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/190/163/)) and 'networked improvement community' ([NIC](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/191/268/)).

**augmenting augmentation**

extending this line of thought, the *dynamic knowledge repository aka community garden* becomes the infrastructure enabling wisdom to emerge; if and to the extent the garden is tended collaboratively, in conversational flow, by a *networked improvement community of gardeners*.

for a few years i've been gradually formulating an amalgam inspired by the DKR-NIC 'twins' – both are needed to set the conditions for wisdom to emerge/ generate/ be yielded and harvested – seeking ways to activate doug’s work based on tom’s *critical distinction between collective intelligence and collective wisdom*. simply put, collective intelligence is not necessarily good for everyone, while wisdom promotes the 'long-term broad benefit of the whole', ie [seven generations or more](https://www.wd-pl.com/24-deep-time-perspective-v2/). this inquiry has led me to discover and collect a rudimentary set of [patterns of 'wise collaboration'](https://www.mindmeister.com/map/2087623427?t=OTGg1nMumi).

the conversation will frame the way forward in spreading awareness, co-learning these endangered legacies, and [‘growing experiments in the community garden’](https://youtu.be/1dI2QeWXFKk?t=3796) particularly with the kernel cohort in which we are immersed.

if you made it this far, you will likely not want to miss this momentous gathering :-)

onward

charles
