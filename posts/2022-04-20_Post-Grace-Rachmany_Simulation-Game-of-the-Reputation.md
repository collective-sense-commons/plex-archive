## Simulation Game of the Reputation Economy
by **Grace Rachmany**

**Voice of Humanity** progresses! The simulation game of the Reputation Economy is fast approaching! We will be doing a simulation in Spain (Navarra region) in mid-May. We are looking for participants who are involved in social enterprises, cooperatives, co-living and intentional communities. All the deets and (sign-up) sheets are here: [https://www.voiceofhumanity.one/reputation-economy-simulation](https://www.voiceofhumanity.one/reputation-economy-simulation). Â I (Grace) will be meeting in person with groups and collecting information for the next few weeks to that end. We will also be holding a number of online alpha tests of the game, starting April 23. It's open to anyone and the online version will be in English (so far).

Thank you to all OGMers who have helped me create the first iteration of the pitch for donations. I have a feeling we will have more iterations, but [this one is much improved](https://youtu.be/R7XcEBFAgws) thanks to the contributions and help from a number of you who were generous with your time. Right now we are fully focused on a successful simulation in May, so anyone who might be a potential donor and would want to join the simulation is welcome! There's no better way to check out our execution capacity as a team and to see how the system will really function.
