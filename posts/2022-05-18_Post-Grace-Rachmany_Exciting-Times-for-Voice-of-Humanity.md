## Exciting Times for Voice of Humanity
by **Grace Rachmany**

The **Voice of Humanity** is moving in all kinds of new directions! The [Sufficiency Currency experiment](https://www.voiceofhumanity.one/reputation-economy-simulation/) did not take place– we weren't able to generate enough physical participants to justify the event. The learnings were:

- Get a team in place.
- Have a local project manager.
- Simplify the game in terms of the administration required in each round.
- Adjust the game for the communities that the founders belong to.

The two spawned activities are:

- Emergence of people who want to participate in a few more game online simulations to see how we can simplify it. **Spirit** will be participating/organizing along with me to figure out how we can do that. We have good feedback from the first players and are happy to have anyone participate.
- [Collaboration with two cofounders and the launch of the Priceless](https://www.voiceofhumanity.one/priceless-economics/) experimentation project. I realized what we are really doing is a lot of experiments rather than a startup with pivots. Priceless is looking at bringing together programmers (for example displaced Ukrainians with software development background) to live in ecological-living-working centers to develop Web3/GameB software that will allow us to do some experiments in different communities. We are already talking to someone who wants to sponsor a location in Slovenia, the ecovillage in Navarra has space for 5-10 adults if we can find some EU funding, and we are looking at creating an operational plan for the Kenyan “sister” location already. We're also looking at being featured in a 100-startups project showcase in the autumn. This evolution of the project has gained momentum very rapidly.

Exciting times for Voice of Humanity!
