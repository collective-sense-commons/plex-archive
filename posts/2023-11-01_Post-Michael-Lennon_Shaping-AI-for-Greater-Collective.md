## Shaping AI for Greater Collective Competence and Contribution
by **Michael Lennon**

Seeking Interviewees for AI Research**: Shaping AI for Greater Collective Competence and Contribution** 

**WHO?**
A Team of highly experienced action researchers and technologists is investigating generative AI’s capacity for amplifying collective competence.  We seek to interview 

**Early adopters of AI, Entrepreneurs, Developers, Tech influencers,
Activists and/or organizational practitioners**

interested in shaping the ***frontiers of prosocial AI use for collective venturing and performance.***

**WHY NOW?
Recent AI performance research published by Harvard Business School shows elite knowledge workers improve *the quality* of their individual performance by up to 40%. **

Hidden in this research is a systemic blind spot about the performance frontiers of knowledge work. It is still commonly believed individual performance feats, individual rock stars, or individual geniuses drive the leading edges of performance and learning.   However, this mindset is mistaken.  *Teams and self-organizing groups consistently produce the most significant innovation, creativity, and performance breakthroughs*.  Dedicated prosocial teams can also influence much larger groups towards prosociality than when acting as individual agents of prosocial change. 

This rapid research will investigate how the collective evolution of AI implementations could evolve to secure greater social and performance benefits from prosocial collective action.

**HOW?**
Interviews will explore several topics: 

a) *current and envisioned collective competence with AI,
b) collective problem-solving practices under stress and adversity, and
c) co-orienting and co-equipping for collective Flourishing and Awe.*

**Research Benefits targeted**
1-on-1 interviews about the present strengths and limits of AI for collective competence and contribution.  These interviews will serve as inputs to ventures aiming to help people use leverage artificial intelligence to understand and grow collective strengths to: 

- Sophisticate their capacity to **understand and forage of the problem landscapes** they face, 
- More nimbly **identify promising pathways through complexity** towards collective achievement,
- **Amplify collective resilience and mutualism** to “fuss forward” constructively when stressed by competition, threat, adversity, and other collective uncertainties, as well as, 
- **Assist collective capacity** **for Regenerative Altruism and Awe- **to assist and extend the contributions of others for collective flourishing. 

Select interviewees may be invited to participate in further action research, design, or prototyping of collective AI implementations.  If interested in contributing to this action research, email [me2we2all@gmail.com](mailto:me2we2all@gmail.com), lennon@gwu.edu, or @happtivist for preliminary assessment not later than 30 Nov 2023.
