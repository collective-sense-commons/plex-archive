## COVID Reminders: Get 2024-2025 Vaccine, Breathe Cleaner Air
by **Peter Kaminski**

I have two recent posts with some of my favorite COVID information sources:

- [Pandemic (still) not over; current wave is pretty bad](https://petescovid19.substack.com/p/pandemic-still-not-over-current-wave)
- [Remember, get your 2024–2025 COVID-19 vaccine soon](https://petescovid19.substack.com/p/remember-get-your-20242025-covid)

Some US COVID stats for this week from [https://pmc19.com/data/](https://pmc19.com/data/):

- There is more COVID-19 transmission today than during 91.6% of the pandemic.
-  Percentage of the Population Infectious: 2.8% (1 in 35)
- New Daily Infections: 1,360,000
- New Weekly Infections: 9,520,000
- Resulting Weekly Long COVID Cases: 476,000 to 1,904,000

Even mild cases of COVID can result in long COVID, which you don't want to get.

Some [advice from Michael Hoerger](https://x.com/michael_hoerger/status/1829011009207459976):

Moreover, families can substantially reduce risk through multi-layered mitigation. Vax up when available. Use serial testing when symptomatic, exposed, for gatherings, or for purposes of asymptomatic surveillance. Wear a well-fitting high-quality mask (N95, KN95, KF94, elastomeric). When someone is sick, use the strictest criteria of the CDC and FDA of requiring 3 negative rapid tests on separate days before ending isolation. Hold meetings virtually and outdoors. Increase indoor air quality by keeping the HVAC 'on' (not 'auto') and using HEPA and DIY air purifiers. Donate masks, tests, and air purifiers to those in your community. Set house rules for precautions, and stick to them. **1/2 to 2/3 of people in the U.S. will NOT get infected this wave, and that might as well be you.**
