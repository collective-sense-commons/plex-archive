## 29th WikiBirthday Calls
### Two calls on Monday, March 25 on Zoom
by **John Abbe**

Next Monday is the 29th anniversary of the launch of the first wiki! On March 25, 1995, Ward Cunningham launched the Portland Pattern Repository, which is still available today at [http://wiki.c2.com/](http://wiki.c2.com/)

Since then, countless other wikis have been born exploring everything from patterns & pattern languages to organizations, to fandoms, to journalistic efforts, to individual projects, to entire movements, and beyond, including of course many of the world's largest encyclopedias. Countless people use wikis every day, because wikis have become a key part of how humans tell – and edit – our stories.

A few dozen people were on a 25th anniversary WikiBirthday call a few years ago, which provoked much joy. In the hopes of having a similarly wonderful time together this year, some of us have organized a couple of video calls to meet with other wiki aficionados. Ward Cunningham will be with us on both of these calls, and we hope you can join us as well!

This invite is also going out to other community-minded technologists, unconference and Open Space organizers, artists, Wikipedians, and many others. It's a chance to share what you are up to with wiki lately, and any new (& old) wiki tools you find useful or promising. We can also highlight past wiki successes, mourn those no longer with us and wiki efforts which didn't work out, reflect on lessons learned, etc.

First call:
10am US Pacific time, 1pm US East, 5pm UK, 6pm Berlin, 10:30pm Mumbai, 4am Sydney

Second call:
6pm Pacific, 9pm East, 1am UK, 2am Berlin, 6:30am Mumbai, noon Sydney

And finally, we can imagine together what we might do for the bigger, 30th anniversary next year.

Please do pass this invitation, or craft one of your own, on to whomever would help us have a wiki time!

— Slow (John Abbe), Mark Dilley, and Ethan McCutchen
