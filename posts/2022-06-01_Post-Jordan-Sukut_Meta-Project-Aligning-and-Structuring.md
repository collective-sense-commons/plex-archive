## Meta Project: Aligning and Structuring
by **Jordan Sukut**

Hello friends and allies,

We are making great progress… and looking forward to all that is next.

We made it through our initial 6 week experiment, and are now moving into longer term organizing, structuring, and federating.

To respect different schedules and desires to connect, we have updated our weekly schedule for Wednesdays (times are PT):

12:20 – 12:30 – Coffee and Community
12:30 – 12:35 – Silent Meditation & Prayer
12:35 – 2:00 – Community Meeting
2:00 – 2:30 – Meeting Retro, and Next Steps For the Week

**If you cannot join the Wednesday meetings, but would like to be on a weekly call, please let me know at [J@Lionsberg.org](mailto:J@Lionsberg.org). **We are intending to open up another weekly time slot in addition to the Wednesday 12:30 PT Navigation Call, and the Thursday 10:00 AM PT Kenya / Africa call.

In case you missed last week, here is the recording: [Meta Project Navigation, 2022-05-25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbKRcyFMhhQ) (gallery view) (YouTube)

Our focus in this cycle is on 1) **Aligning and Structuring**, 2) **Federating** and 3) **Resourcing.**

On June 1, we reported out updates on last week's action items, and I proposed as a next step that we begin to see if we can “act out” the conceptual [Meta Project] through a tangible **structure and system** that we co-created over the last few years for this moment in time. I'll do a brief presentation of the system and logic, to open a gateway towards dialogue.

Based on that dialogue and the questions and issues that arise, we plan to do a video presentation over the next week for those who want to take a deeper dive asynchronously.

This would allow us to work with the [Meta Project] in two ways: 1) as an abstract concept, and 2) as an embodied reality that we are trying to [Realize].

**Structure: **If the group agrees that the:

- The Lionsberg legal, governance, and process infrastructure and 501(c)(3) we built as a “commons” is adequate / safe / good enough to serve as a ***starting point for continuous evolution and improvement***, then we have 'rubber on the road' in terms of ***structure***.

**Federating: **The next steps would then be:

- To get everyone engaged in participating in or hosting at least one [Circle / Pod / Sovereign] of at least 3 people (recommended) committed to shared 1) Purpose 2) Principles and 3) Values.
- To get those [Circles / Pods / Sovereigns] **federating **into higher order functional unity while continuously improving the **shared structure / infrastructure** of the federation.

**Aligning Projects and Goals**: If we can **Federate**, it becomes possible for:

- The **Federation / Community **to begin selecting and executing on **Goals **that advance the **[Critical Path]** the way towards the **[Meta Goal].**

**Resourcing**: If we can demonstrate our ability to **structure **and **federate **and **align projects and goals **across [Sovereigns], we will have demonstrated tremendous **value**, that can then be transacted on to resource the community.

- Present the **value** that is being created to catalyze the basic **economy** of the **ecosystem**.

It seems we are approximately on track, and we now need to get structured and begin growing by testing ourselves / executing / learning forward, and progressively increasing our functional capabilities as a community.

If anyone senses that we are on the wrong track, or not heading in approximately the right direction, please let me know so we can calibrate our instruments, navigate together, and remain structurally interoperable into the future.

The many different elements that need to be designed / built / implemented that I have discussed with each of you are still in play, implied by the [Goal], and will be addressed at the wise right time.

If we can inspire a global community to design and build itself, all that is required to design and build a better world follows.

With Love, In Community,

~ J
