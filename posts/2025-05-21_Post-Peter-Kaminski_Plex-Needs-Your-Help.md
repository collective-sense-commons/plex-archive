## Plex Needs Your Help
by **Peter Kaminski**

Hi there, I’m Pete, your intrepid Plex editor.

My intent with the Biweekly Plex Dispatch has always been to share news and views *from* a set of interlinked communities, *with* the communities. As I don’t have the time to be a beat reporter, going out to investigate and coming back with news, I rely on asking members of the community “what’s up?” and “have you got anything the Plex readers should know about?”

For those of you who have contributed articles to the Plex, **thank you so much!!!** It’s super meaningful and super helpful, and I’m honored to play a small part in sharing your work with your friends and colleagues.

The truth is, though, I need to hear from more of you! I would like to broaden the contributions from our regular community or two, and for those of you in multiple communities, what’s going on over *there* that we should know about *here*.

If you’re able to help by contributing an article once in a while, send me an email. If you’ve got questions about whether or not something is relevant, or how to structure an article so that it’s interesting to Plex readers, send me an email. If you like to see more how the Plex is put together, and maybe even help, send me an email! I’m at [kaminski@istori.com](mailto:kaminski@istori.com).

Thank you!
