### What is an Ag Data Wallet?
The vision for an agricultural data wallet (**Ag Data Wallet** or **ADW**) is a digital tool where farmers, ranchers, and land stewards can access and manage their data and decide whether others can see it too. Control over what specific data is available to others, and on what terms, is a critical aspect of this vision.
