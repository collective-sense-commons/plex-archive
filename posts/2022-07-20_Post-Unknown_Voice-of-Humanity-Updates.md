## Voice of Humanity Updates
In keeping with the announcements of office hours, Grace regularly holds **office hours on Thursdays (DAO Hours)** which are in an AMA format.  [Thursday mornings at 7:30 AM UTC](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZEkc-6rqzspG9XYlHPsBwZG9i-5gYfhpmVV) and [Thursday evenings 18:30 UTC](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZAtf-qspz4uE92HY5e3inRJvXxW8d0gimAx). Anywhere from 0 to 4 people show up and it's in AMA format, so feel free to sign up and drop in. For one-on-ones, she definitely has time for OGMers and they can just ping her.

The **Priceless Economics** team is reading Balaji's **“The Network State”** and starting to respond through a [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz/) blog. The first entry is here: [PricelessDAO: It's not about a clean slate](https://mirror.xyz/gracedao.eth/2H5SEJGFUSnpRUiaNgzDHqmOF_vyzvPM_1XS75pPEEs).   

Expect the series to be at least 10 blogs long as the framework is perfect for what we are doing. We don't want to share too much at this point, but there will be an official launch fairly soon.

Grace is at her 3rd conference in 3 weeks. **Emerge Gathering Austin**, the **[GEN-EU Ecovillage Gathering](https://ecovillagegathering.org/)**, and **[ETHcc](https://ethcc.io/)**. Too much to review, but one of the most inspiring but also frightening stories was of the **GEN Ukraine** group and the support they got from the Danish network to fund helping thousands of their displaced countrymen settle in the countryside temporarily–or not-so-temporarily, learn some gardening, and find a new way of life.

As a group, there was an overall sense that “What if we were right all along” about ecovillages being the only viable way of life, and “We are not prepared for what is already upon us”. The atmosphere was celebratory though the gravity of the situation was clear.

The **[GEN Ukraine](https://genukraine.com.ua/index.php/en/)** group is looking to build housing before the winter hits, so if you are interested in helping with the effort, please reach out to them. In addition to donations, they are looking for people who could serve as a guarantor for loans if they do not reach their fundraising goals.
