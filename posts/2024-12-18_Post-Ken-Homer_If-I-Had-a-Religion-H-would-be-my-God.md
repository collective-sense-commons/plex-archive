## If I Had a Religion, H would be my God
by **Ken Homer**

“If you wish to bake and apple pie from scratch, you must first create the Universe.” ~ Carl Sagan

If I had a religion, I’d nominate H (Hydrogen) to fill the role of God
H is the first element birthed by our Universe after our Universe exploded into existence
Us-humans don’t know what existed before our Universe – it’s A Mystery
Some call The Mysterious Origin of The Universe The Big Bang
Some call it The Godhead or The Great Tao
Some call it The Origin of All Things
Still others refer to it as The Primal Flaring Forth or The Singularity
Regardless of what you call it, It will always remain an insoluble Mystery

Our best guess is that our Universe was birthed out of an infinitesimally small space
that contained a nearly infinite amount of energy and that our Universe
came into existence as the result of an explosion of unimaginable magnitude
Then, moments later, in Universe time, H appeared

If you go back in time far enough you find everything traces back to H
And H is the most abundant element in the Universe
I don’t know about you, but I want a God that’s abundant

Humans will never solve the Mystery of The Origin of The Universe
And no less a character than The Buddha
warned that the search for the Origin of the Universe is fruitless
(He said it can drive you crazy!)

The Origin of All Things birthed Time itself and humans can’t know
what was present before Time existed because we’re timebound creatures
That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to learn all that we can about The Mystery
Lots of useful things can be discovered in the process of trying to know It

The Godlike thing about Hydrogen isn’t just that
it’s the most common element in the Universe
It’s that, left alone, Hydrogen eventually turns into stars and galaxies
and into solar systems with planets and moons and comets
and into water and land and forests and grass and giraffes and peoples
H does not demand any praise or worship or supplication or devotion
To me that’s as close to what a God could/should be as I can imagine
