## Plex Open House, 23 April
by **Peter Kaminski**

Come join me, your intrepid Biweekly Plex Dispatch editor/publisher, on Wednesday, 23 April 2025 for a Plex Open House!

Let’s talk about what you like or dislike about Plex, where it might go in the future, and whatever else comes up. Bonus: if folks are interested, a demo of how to put together Plex and other newsletters in both Ghost and Substack.
