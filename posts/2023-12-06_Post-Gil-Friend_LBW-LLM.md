## LBW LLM
by **Gil Friend**

Over the past four years, more than 700 people have engaged in an ongoing conversation about the challenge of living between worlds…in this liminal time when, as Antonio Gramsci put it 100 years ago, “the old world is dying, and a new world struggles to be born.”

Now, in what Adam Tooze dubbed the polycrisis (hint: there is no “the”), what Daniel Schmachtenberger perhaps more accurately called metacrisis, what Gramsci more viscerally called the time of monsters, what Chauncey Bell simply calls a mess, we struggle  to find our footing. To find our bearings. To find our way. To find meaning. To live in these times, with grace, dignity, and power. 

The conversations have been profound and provocative, covering topics that have included climate and covid (where we started in early 2020) to systems change, hope, capital-ism, and “can we afford a future?” (You can [prowl the video archives](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL202gED-y1zOml0saofx2Nk3E3ES28TMt) here. And while you’re there, please like and subscribe!)

This month it will be experimental as well. We’ve trained an LLM (a large language model, also known as “an AI”) on the entire corpus of our conversations, to see what would be like to have a probing conversation with ourselves—or, more accurately, with a representation of ourselves that offers a different way of finding pattern (and perhaps meaning) then we do.

We hope you’ll join us to interrogate the beast, to see what it can and can’t do, to see how it might surprise us and what new conversations it might provoke in us, and to suggest whether and how we might develop it further. (And to see what tricks we have up our sleeves — some of which we think you’ve never seen before.)
