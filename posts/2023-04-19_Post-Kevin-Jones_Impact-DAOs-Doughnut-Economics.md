## Impact DAOs, Doughnut Economics
by **Kevin Jones** and **Ken Homer**

*Kevin writes,*

I’m exploring working with folks in the **impact DAO** community, using a **doughnut economics** lens on curating a convening of domestic, economic justice mixed with environmental justice-focused impact DAOs as one strand of our February conference in San Antonio.

Anyone who’s been following Kevin Doyle Jones’ work for a while has heard him talk about Doughnut Economics. If you aren’t yet familiar with Kate Raworth’s work, here’s a 16 min TED Talk that’s a brilliant intro:

20th C. economics assured us that if growth creates inequality, don’t try to redistribute because more growth will even things up. If growth creates pollution, don’t try to regulate, because more growth will clean things up. Except, it turns out, it doesn’t and it won’t. We need to create economies that tackle this overshoot and shortfall together, by design. We need economies that are regenerative and distributive, by design. ~Kate Raworth
