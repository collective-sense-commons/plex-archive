## Co-Creating A Thriving Future for the Bay Area: An Unconference, 3 May
by **David Witzel**

**Co-Creating A Thriving Future for the Bay Area: An Unconference**
*Saturday May 3, 2025 at Laney College in Oakland, CA*

These are days of darkness & possibility, uncertainty & opportunity. We are calling doers and dreamers from all walks of life to join together and create the story of a thriving future for all life, where we live: the Bay Delta Bioregion, and its many beautiful watersheds and communities.

**The Question: *How do we better collaborate within and across communities and watersheds to co-create a thriving future for all life?***

Sessions will cover a wide range of topics, such as local food systems, bioregionalism, land stewardship, social justice, solidarity economy, ecological restoration, regenerative practices, Indigenous leadership, storytelling, solarpunk, the “collapse”, and cooperation. Formats will run the gamut from inspiring conversations to somatic exercises to “roll up your sleeves” problem-solving.

This event is for everyone whether you’re professionally involved, active as a volunteer and community member,  or curious about how you can contribute.
