## Collabathon ‘23
by the **CTA Collabathon team**

Announcing the first **Collaborative Technology Alliance Collabathon!**

*[Image not included in the current archive. Images may be included in the future.]*

*The **Collabathon** is a multi-week, asynchronous hackathon, intended to catalyze and fund new or existing projects focused on activating cross platform interoperability and collaboration, hosted by the CTA.*

We will be kicking things off on Tuesday, January 24, with multiple launch events that day.

Over the last year we’ve built wonderful community, shared our projects with one another, and initiated a number of collaborations of various sizes and scopes. We’ve launched a [new website](https://collaborative.tech/), agreed on a set of [CTA principles](https://collaborative.tech/principles) and gathered signatures on our [CTA pledge](https://dkejevlwldw.typeform.com/to/HOeA9PWJ). And yet, it’s been hard to activate and sustain longer, deeper cross-organization collaborations over time. So we have decided to take the rest of our CTA seed funding, around $30k (and we hope to raise more from sponsors) and use it to incubate and activate projects that we believe will contribute to the long term goals of the alliance.

We are asking:

*How can we catalyze more collaboration among social technologists who align with the CTA principles, across projects/organizations? What does it take to break down the barriers of collaboration and interoperability?*

This convening will stretch across several months, with the following goals:

- Fund important projects related to the CTA’s purpose and principles
- Experiment with a participatory community process to decide what we want to fund
- See what it feels like to collaborate more deeply across our organizations / projects
- Bring the CTA vision and principles out into the world more
- Build even more community among CTA members

## Projects areas we want to fund:
Technical interoperability & data portability across social platforms. e.g.

- Agreeing on shared data schemas, to make it easy to export / import data
- Working on API integrations, or experimenting with adopting standard protocols
- Sovereign identity (e.g. adopting DID-based login)

Social platform ethics and accountability, e.g.

- Creating shared Terms of Service, data use agreements and privacy policies
- Nutrition labels for social platforms
- Exploring Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion in the collaborative tech space

Platform coops and data commons. e.g.

- Sharing legal support to find aligned org structures and business models
- Designing cross-alliance governance of shared resources

Social interoperability. e.g.

- Facilitated explorations of what gets in the way of people working together
- Mapping the collaborative tech ecosystem in useful ways

Other projects that align with the purpose of the CTA or would support CTA member platforms.

**For more information on the plan and timeline, and how to get involved,** check out the **[Collabathon ‘23 page](https://www.collaborative.tech/collabathon-23).**

Let’s kick off 2023 by weaving our work together, so we can overgrow the extractive, attention economy with a new tech ecosystem based on solidarity and cooperation!
