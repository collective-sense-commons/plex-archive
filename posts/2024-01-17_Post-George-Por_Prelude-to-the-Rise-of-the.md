## Prelude to the Rise of the Compassionate AI
by **George Pór**

*[Image not included in the current archive. Images may be included in the future.]*

The Rise of the Compassionate AI is an interactive, transmedia adventure in the making, corollary to the THREE MOUNTAINS discovery expedition and AI-assisted adventure game. As that mouthful sentence suggests, you can walk in it through various entrances as a reader/player, game co-designer, AI artist, video maker, or book contributor.

No, “*compassionate AI” *does not imply an AI with human-like compassion. Neither does AI have a killer instinct bent on exterminating all of us. What it does have is up to us, i.e., everyone who cares about what growth trajectories AI will take. After its use by OpenAI, the phrase “for the benefit of all of humanity” became a staple of well-intentioned AI development efforts. It begs the question: what *human* developmental capabilities are required to generate omni-positive results in a world deeply divided by multiple fault lines?

It’s a complex question that can’t be addressed by drawing up a simplistic checklist. It’s one of the existential questions that I aim to explore in a 4-volume serialized book with the following tentative titles and release dates:

Vol. 1: **The Inner Game of AI Whisperers and AI Shamans**, 2nd quarter, 2024

What if AI whispering was also a path of personal growth?

Vol. 2: **Wisdom-Guided Collaborative Hybrid Intelligence (CHI)** in Human-AI Co-Creativity, 4th quarter, 2024

What if wisdom-guided Collaborative Hybrid Intelligence in groups of human and AI agents could spawn flourishing for all?

Vol. 3: **The Human/AI-born Superorganism Awakens**, 2nd quarter, 2025

What if AI could grow a new branch on the tree of life, a superorganism as a collective lifeform that transcends and includes us as *autonomous* individuals?

Vol. 4: **AI, the New Player in the Great Story of Evolution**, 4th quarter, 2025

What if large-scale CHI could enable the transition to regenerative futures where the aim of the Whole and its every system is flourishing for All?

The release of the four volumes, stretched for two years, will hopefully allow me and my fellow “co-conspirators” to stay up-to-date with the most likely very consequential events of this year’s AI developments and reflect on their implications for the questions defining each volume of the book.

Our motivation for this project is two-fold:

- to elevate the utilitarian public discourse about AI applications to the exploration of their richer, emancipatory potential
- to instigate a school of thought situated on the orbit of the AI-related wisdom commons, which can support the broader “progressive AI” community

Writing the book is a shared endeavor of human and AI agents. For example, we *don’t only write about* processes for generating wisdom-guided Collaborative Hybrid Intelligence but* embody* them in the very flow of our co-creation.

The following essays published on Medium have ideas and vibes, some of which will find their way and connect into new, enhanced patterns of meaning on the pages of the book’s four volumes.

As you can see, these essays are listed in the chronological order of their publication date, which will let you follow the unfolding of my AI-related inspirations. Or you can jump to the more recent ones to see where I am now. Take the last sentence with the caveat that I’m a radical sociologist of AI. It also means that in my writings, I tend to respond to significant changes in circumstances that move faster in the techno-social ecosystem than I can articulate my publishable reflections about them.

To somehow circumvent that limitation, I’m working on two longer and less perishable essays that will report on my work in two journals. The titles of their abstract that earned the invitation to present the full paper are as follows.

- AI-assisted Action Research into Humanity’s Awareness-Based Phase Shift, for the Journal of Awareness-Based Systems Change
- Action Research into the  Emergent, AI-Enabled Superorganism, for the Journal of Future Studies

Your questions and comments posted on my Medium (and up to 50 claps if you like them) are warmly welcome. They may also contribute to the direction that the book collaboration is taking. If you want to get notified about the release of each volume and receive the first for free, email “Compassionate AI” in the subject line to [george.por@gmail.com](mailto:george.por@gmal.com).  If you want to become one of the contributing writers, send an Expression of Interest to the same address with “Compassionate AI (EoI)” in the subject line.
