## Regenerative or Greenwashed
by **Klaus Mager**

In the realm of industrial agriculture, where endless expanses of monoculture fields dominate the landscape, a silent crisis looms over the soil. With fewer than 60 harvests remaining before widespread topsoil depletion, as warned by the UN, the future of farmland fertility hangs in the balance. Concurrently, the nutritional value of our food is dwindling, while the prevalence of toxins and heavy metals in our diets is escalating. This contributes to a surge in diet-related illnesses that now top the global mortality charts, straining healthcare systems worldwide.

Coupled with the escalating challenges of climate change—disturbed water cycles, prolonged scorching growing periods, and erratic weather patterns—the outlook for our contemporary food production system appears grim and unsustainable.

Recently, McKinsey & Company presented a report on regenerative agriculture as a potential solution, outlining strategies to rejuvenate farming practices while maintaining economic viability. Although the concept of no-till cultivation, cover crops, and carbon trading seems promising at first glance, a deeper examination uncovers a contrasting reality.

In this newsletter, I delve into a more intricate analysis, revealing that McKinsey’s suggestions, while offering marginal enhancements to the prevailing mono-cropping model, fall short of the radical transformations necessary to revive soil vitality, foster ecosystem regeneration, and ensure global food security.
