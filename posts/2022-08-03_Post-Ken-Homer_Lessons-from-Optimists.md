## Lessons from Optimists
by **Ken Homer**

Moods are to emotions what weather is to climate – they are predispositions to action. There’s no denying that our species is going through a tumultuous phase right now. Most people are aware of the existential threats unfolding all around us. Many of these threats are human-created, and thus my hope is that they can be human-dissolved. The mood of a great number of people is suboptimal for coping with such threats and this mood is fed and amplified to a large degree by both social and broadcast media. To address existential threats, people need access to **moods of wonder, curiosity, ambition, and possibility.**

A few years ago, I was invited to create and teach a course on ***Coaching Skills for Wellbeing*** at San Francisco State University. In preparing that course, I realized that I am usually an optimistic person, but that my long-term view of humanity’s prospects is darkened by what I know about the various threats to our biosphere. These threats paint a grim picture of our future, and we don’t yet know how to solve them. My long-term view frequently compromises my ability to stay buoyant in my daily life. I decided to interview some self-identified optimists to see if I could learn from them how to better balance my short-term optimism with my long-term sense of dread. It was a fun and interesting project, and I did indeed gain some significant insights into how to be more balanced. Here’s a summary of my anecdotal findings.

**Who I Spoke With**

- Six people
- All over 50
- Three Women and Three Men
- Three People of African Descent
- Three People of European Descent

**Q: When did you realize you were an optimistic person?**

- Five out of six said they’ve been optimistic their whole lives.
- One reported she had to learn how to be optimistic.
- Two stated that although they are optimistic people, they struggle with depression and anxiety.
- All spoke of how being optimistic increases their sense of agency, possibility, satisfaction, joy, love, and fulfillment in life.

**Q: How do you maintain an optimistic outlook in the face of daily challenges – big and small?**

- Have a sense of The Big Picture – asking: does this really matter in the long run?
- Developing a daily gratitude practice – it is amazing how well this works.
- The Serenity Prayer – accepting what I cannot change, focusing on what I can change.
- Being mindful of what I allow in my life – avoiding negative and toxic conversations, people, news, and environments.
- Seeing events as neutral – it’s not what’s happening, it’s my attitude about what’s occurring that determines if something is good or bad for me.
- Recognizing that I am not my past, it’s how I respond to what happens to me that matters.
- Allowing myself to deeply feel my emotions so they can move through me.

**Q: What specific practices do you turn to when you find yourself tested?**

**Top Responses:**

- Exercise – I get moving and get my heart rate up.
- Diet – I make sure I am avoiding junk foods and eating health supportive foods instead.
- Time in nature – being outdoors opens up different perspectives.
- Calling friends and family who will lift me up.
- Meditation – sitting or moving: accessing a calmer, quieter space within.
- Self-compassion – I am one person, not everything is up to me.
- Accepting and reframing – asking, how can I turn this to my advantage?
- Be able to vent – have people you can vent to who will listen and say: OK, now what?
- Steering by rear view mirror* – remembering challenges my ancestors overcame.
- Prayer – faith in God, Nature, a Higher Power, or a Benevolent Presence.
- Blending with – the practice of stepping into and moving with the resistance.
- Zooming out – expanding the timeframe to 10,000 years.
- Practice dwelling in not knowing, giving space to complex and confounding things.
- Envisioning the world if all the terrible things I think of don’t actually come to pass.
- Paying attention to my body and my thought loops.
- Knowing that everything changes in its own time, accepting that I can’t push the river.

**Q: When have you been hard pressed to stay optimistic?**

**Dealing with:**

- Major health crisis.
- Loss of loved one.
- Difficult family matter/member.
- Coming to grips with own mortality.
- Coping with depression.

**Q: How do you use optimism when dealing with transitions?**

- Seeing challenge as opportunity for growth.
- Recalling lessons I’ve learned when I’ve gone through other rough patches.
- Keeping my sense of humor – life is too tragic to take seriously.
- Talking out my feelings with trusted friends or family members.
- Telling the truth about what is happening – don’t sugarcoat or succumb to denial.
- Fully feeling any difficult emotions while knowing that they will pass, and that I will grow from the experience.
- Focusing on what is possible and what I can do now with what I have, where I am.
- Reaching out and asking for help.

**Q: How do you use optimism when dealing with transitions?**

- Building momentum from small things.
- Acknowledging fear and listening to love.
- Being insatiably curious!
- Staying in touch with childlike wonder.
- Focusing on what I can do and letting the rest take care of itself.
- Never give up! If you never give up, you will never fail.
- Being my own strengths-based coach – I believe in me!

**Comments from interviewees:**

- Being optimistic doesn’t mean everything is great all the time, I struggle with hardships like everyone else, I just have a perspective that sooner or later the hard time will pass, things will work out, and I’ll feel good again. And so far, this has proven true.
- I learned early on that the world is a harsh and impersonal place where both miracles and horrors take place. If my state of mind is dependent on things in the world working well, I am setting myself up for failure. I do what I can to make a positive difference and then I let go and let the world take care of itself.

When I inquired what she meant, she stated that her ancestors have been in the USA for over 150 years, arriving from Africa as slaves. They were thrown into a world where they had no legal rights as human beings (see SCOTUS’ [Dred Scott ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott)decision). They did not give up hope but persevered and so when she is feeling overwhelmed, she draws on their strength and fortitude because, as she put it: “if they didn’t give up despite being virtually powerless in the face of horrible repression, I can’t let them down by succumbing to my despair when I have so much more agency than they did.”

** “Steering through the rearview mirror” came from a person of African descent.*
