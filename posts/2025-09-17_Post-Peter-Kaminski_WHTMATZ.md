### What Happened To Me At The Zoo
by **Peter Kaminski**

*Another “*[*What Happened To Me*](https://plex-archive.collectivesensecommons.org/posts/2025-08-20_post-peter-kaminski_call-for-whtm-posts)*” post. *[*Send **your** WHTM to Kevin*](mailto:kevindoylejones1@gmail.com)*–they’re fun!*

I’m lucky to live near fellow OGMer Jack Park and his wife Linda. For various reasons (pandemic among others), my wife and I hadn’t visited the San Diego Zoo or the San Diego Zoo Safari Park in our five years in living in San Diego.

Luckily for us, the zoo is one of the spots Jack and Linda visit when they’re out and about, so Jack recently invited us to tag along. That (and N95 masks as appropriate) were enough to get us to finally buy zoo memberships so we can start going regularly.

The zoo is HUGE. *(The San Diego Zoo is a 100-acre wildlife park that is home to more than 12,000 rare and endangered animals representing over 680 species and subspecies. Located just north of downtown San Diego in Balboa Park, the Zoo is also an accredited botanical garden, caring for more than 700,000 individual plants, including a prominent assemblage of close to 13,000 specimens representing 3,100 species.–*[*San Diego Zoo 2025 Fact Sheet*](https://sandiegozoowildlifealliance.org/pressroom/san-diego-zoo-fact-sheet)*)*

Jack and Linda were friendly and capable zoo guides, and we ambled and rode (tour bus and aerial tramway) around the zoo, collecting various impressions of the animals and plants. Jack and I kibitzed about various OGM topics, too, of course. A lovely time was had by all.
