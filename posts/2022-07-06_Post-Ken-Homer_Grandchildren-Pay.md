## Grandchildren Pay
### A parable for our times
by **Ken Homer**

One day a hungry man was walking past a restaurant where the most amazing aromas were wafting out to the street. A sign in the window caught his eye:

Come in and enjoy – all you can eat!
Your grandchildren will pay the bill!Hesitating slightly, he approached the door and opened it. The restaurant was lavishly appointed with dark wood, crystal chandeliers, plush carpeting, leather seats in the booths and tables set with fine linens, silver and china. But what really drew his attention was the buffet. Several huge tables ran the entire length of the room, heaped with platters of every kind of dish imaginable: seafood, game, meats, casseroles, grains, pastas, savory vegetables, salads, appetizers and soups. The sight of all this food and the incredible aroma of so many delicious dishes practically made him dizzy.

A waiter appeared out of nowhere and led him to a booth where was he told to take his plate and help himself. The man filled his plate three times and gorged himself. Fine wines were poured for him with each course. Afterwards, a dessert cart came by and he had several desserts accompanied by delicious coffee and exquisite port.

He sat for a long while, lingering over the port and enjoying the feeling of fullness. As much as he hated to leave, he knew he must, so he pushed back from the table and made his way to the door. Just as he placed his hand on the knob, the waiter again appeared out of nowhere and handed him a bill.

Shocked, he protested: “But the sign! It said that my grandchildren would pay for me!”

“That is correct, sir,” replied the waiter. “This is the bill for your grandparents.”
