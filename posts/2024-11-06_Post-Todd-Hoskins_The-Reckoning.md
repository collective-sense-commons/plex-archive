## The Reckoning
by **Todd Hoskins**

The people have spoken
They are angry
And fearful

Many did not speak
They are angry too

We could blame
Misinformation or profit-driven media
Citizens United and dysregulated capitalism
Fears of women
Accents, different beliefs, colors, and cultures
Malignant foreign actors or US imperialism
Social media and the failure of the education system
Musk or Trump or McConnell
Corruption or greed

But their anger is justified
Even if misplaced
We have not honored life
Our systems are broken
Tectonic plates shift under our feet
No matter who is tending the garden

The spiritual crisis drags along
Expressed through
Unimaginative governance
Plunder
Hopelessness
Death and addiction

We wanted stability
To face the crises
To feel safe and secure

But rage and fear do not carefully select
A best solution

Do not call the angry
Stupid or ignorant

They are not simply
Choosing a dictator
Manipulated
Or uninformed

We all know Kali
In blazing fire
Roaring wind
Trembling earth
And rushing waters
Reshuffling the elements
Beyond good and evil
She is not reasonable

There is wisdom in millions of people
Pleading for disruption
Even if some may think
They have found their savior

Perhaps we will thank them
For hastening the reckoning

Let us join them in anger
Not at each other
But at what we’ve allowed

Somewhere beneath that anger
Is love and life
Care and hope

There is grief here too
Far deeper
Than one fateful election

It’s knowing who we are
Is not who we thought we were

This nation was built
On ambitious ideals
But also rebels
Vanquishers and vagabonds
Opportunists and separatists

Were we ever united
When we shook and took
From the land
The native peoples
And looked the other way?

Yet the sacred persists
In a smile
Singing of birds
Gentle breeze
Touch of skin
Fresh fruit
Wag of a tail

The reckoning can bring life
If I stay open to it
