## The Swannanoa Watershed Questions
*via **Kevin Jones***

Questions we are asking in our watershed. (I did not write them.)

We are just a group of people who care about this place, not institutions or organizations, though some of us come from them or lead them.

Dear colleagues,

We began our conversation on the Swannanoa Watershed in relation to [Kate Raworth's doughnut model of regenerative development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doughnut_(economic_model)). The following are questions related to each of the doughnut categories for overshooting the ecological ceiling and the shortfalls related to the social foundations. 

### Ecological Ceiling Overshoots
How are human activities in the Swannanoa Watershed contributing to the overshoot of the ecological ceiling contributing to climate change, ozone layer depletion, air pollution, biodiversity loss, land conversion, freshwater withdrawals, nitrogen and phosphorous loading, chemical pollution and ocean acidification? What actions can we take to help reduce these overshoots?

### Social Foundation Shortfalls
How are human activities in the Swannanoa Watershed contributing to the shortfall of the social foundations of education, income and work, peace and justice, political voice, social equity, gender equality, housing networks, energy, water, food, and health? What actions can we take to help reduce these shortfalls?

Let's think about how we can address these questions.
