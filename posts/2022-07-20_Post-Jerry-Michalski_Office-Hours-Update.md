## Office Hours Update
An update from last issue.

Ever wanted to talk with somebody, but “didn't want to bother them?”

On the **Plex Weekly Calendar,** you'll see **Pete** and **Grace (DAO AMA)** in the grid, and a link to **Jerry's schedule** in the notes below the grid.

**Stacey** is currently on hiatus from office hours.

Hey, do you want to set up office hours, too? Send an email to **[Pete](mailto:kaminski@istori.com)** to get listed on the calendar, or for tips and tricks about setting up your call.

For additional details, also see [OGM Culture / Office Hours - OGM Wiki](https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/ogm_culture/office_hours).
