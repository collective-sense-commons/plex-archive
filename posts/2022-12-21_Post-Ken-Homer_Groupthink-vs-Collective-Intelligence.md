## Groupthink vs Collective Intelligence
### Which is Better for Your Organization?

A few years ago, I was talking with a colleague when she asked what the focus of my work is. I mentioned that part of my focus is helping groups create the conditions for the emergence of collective intelligence (CIQ). She caught me off guard when she asked, “Isn’t collective intelligence just groupthink?” I didn’t have a good answer at the time, and I decided to work up a more robust way of articulating why CIQ is better than groupthink.

The definition I use for collective intelligence is: *Connecting people and computers in ways that broaden their knowledge, enable them to cope with high levels of complexity, and help them to make better decisions together than they if they acted alone.*

Wikipedia defines [Groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink) as: “a psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people in which the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an irrational or dysfunctional decision-making outcome. Group members try to minimize conflict and reach a consensus decision without critical evaluation of alternative viewpoints by actively suppressing dissenting viewpoints, and by isolating themselves from outside influences.”

I thought a side-by-side comparison would be useful:

  table.styled, table.styled > th, table.styled > td {border:1px solid black; border-collapse:collapse;padding:.5em;}
  table.styled > thead > tr: {background: #fff}
  table.styled > tbody > tr:nth-child(odd) {background: #eee}
  table.styled> tbody > tr:nth-child(even) {background: #fff}

Groupthink
Collective Intelligence

Power is consolidated at the top
Power is distributed throughout the network

Leaders are not to be questioned
Leaders actively solicit dissenting opinions

People defer to a single leader
Leadership is a shared responsibility

Dissent gets you marginalized or ostracized
Dissenting views are fodder for learning 

Assumptions go unexamined
Assumptions are continually questioned

Only “qualified” people can contribute
All stakeholders are invited to contribute

To admit to making a mistake is to fail
Mistakes are valued as part of learning 

Drive for conformity fosters oversimplification and devalues diverse perspectives 
Desire to understand complexity engages and synthesizes diverse perspectives

Complexity gets reduced to sound-bites and slogans which can lead to dehumanization
Multiple intelligences are engaged to reach deep and nuanced understanding

Opinions and/or evidence contrary to official position is dismissed as being biased or fake
Positions and opinions continually revised based on new information and evidence

The quick and eloquent dominate conversations
Those who need time to think are given the opportunity to formulate their positions

Emotions of anger and fear dominate and are used to intimidate and manipulate 
Anger and fear are carefully explored to mitigate their corrosive effects 

Kindness, empathy, and compassion are seen as signs of weakness
Kindness, empathy, and compassion are seen as integral to the group’s success

Low tolerance for discomfort – the need to move to action overcomes prudence – often with poor results
High tolerance for discomfort – people sit with ambiguity and difficult emotions until a way forward is found

How does this list strike you? What would you add or change in it?
