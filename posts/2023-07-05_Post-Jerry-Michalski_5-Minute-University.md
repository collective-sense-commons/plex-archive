## 5-Minute University
by **Jerry Michalski**

In this week's OGM Thursday call, we're going to test the 5-Minute University format. You'll find details on how, [here](https://wiki.openglobalmind.com/5-minute_universities) (written for recording and posting 5minUs; adapt for live). Please consider sharing something you care about, and [email Jerry](mailto:sociate@gmail.com) to get on the list to present.

Because the format is 5 minutes presenting, followed by 5 minutes of Q&A, we have *max* room for 9 presenters in one OGM call. If this works well, we'll add it to our formats and do it again.

Please rehearse your presentation and trim it back to 5 minutes. You won't have time to tell us everything you know about the topic, so distill it until the most important things remain.

Separately, summer travel plans are shifting the NeoBook project to asynchronous mode, which means we won't hold the Monday calls (usually at 10:30am Pacific) until August 6.
