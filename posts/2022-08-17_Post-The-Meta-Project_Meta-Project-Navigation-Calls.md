# Meta Project Navigation Calls

**Author:** [[The Meta Project]]

## Meta Project Navigation Calls
Wednesdays at 12:30pm Pacific Time, 3:30pm Eastern Time, via Zoom. Email [Jordan](mailto:j@lionsberg.org) for the Zoom link.

The Meta Project Navigation calls are weekly updates and working / navigation calls for people working on The Meta Project. Jordan facilitates the team through different call formats, as the team and the project grows and evolves.

Pete has published a number of the call recordings in [The Meta Project YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLADGyQqAcmioZVw88tP3pPG_5z_aNKmwP), but the playlist is current a couple months out of date. Pete hopes to catch the playlist back up at some point.

See [Your Starting Point](https://lionsberg.wiki/lionsberg_system_design/your_story_and_quest/your_starting_point) (lionsberg.wiki) for more information on Lionsberg and The Meta Project.
