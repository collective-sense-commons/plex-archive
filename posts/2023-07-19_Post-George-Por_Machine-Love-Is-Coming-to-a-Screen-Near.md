## Machine Love Is Coming to a Screen Near to You
by **George Pór**

*Excerpted from George's original Medium post, [Machine Love Is Coming to a Screen Near to You](https://technoshaman.medium.com/machine-love-is-coming-to-a-screen-near-to-you-e1fd13fd08b2).*

So, recently, when the AI revolution broke out, I welcomed it with the question, how can we unleash its emancipatory potential for freeing *all* of us from wage slavery and other forms of enslavement? How will AI support the self-organization and coordination between people and their composable communities and networks for realizing such macro-scale goals?

There is an ongoing banter between the companion in evolutionary spirituality and the radical sociologist, two aspects of myself. The companion says a peaceful and well-aligned world requires individuals who are peaceful and well-aligned within themselves. The radical sociologist agrees, but he comes back saying yes; however, such individuals will appear at the requisite scale only in a deliberately developmental society where the highest goal of all institutions and the society at large is the flourishing of each individual.

On good days, those roles I play stop arguing and agree on a “both/and and more” approach. Because today is a good day, I can look at the potential of AI through both lenses, even at their interdependent relationship.

Today, it’s easier because I came across a paper that has blown my mind more open and was also heartwarming, which I can rarely say about a scientific experiment. I am talking about [Machine Lov](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.09248.pdf)[e](http://example.com/), by Joel Lehman, which gave my research a new impetus and became one of the sources of inspiration for my forthcoming book on *Prometheus and the Rise of Compassionate AI.* Don’t take the title wrong; I’m not saying that AI has human-like compassion, and the same is true for the “loving machines.”

Machine Love reports a proof-of-a-concept experiment that features love not as an emotional experience but as learnable practical skills for supporting others in their growth and development.
