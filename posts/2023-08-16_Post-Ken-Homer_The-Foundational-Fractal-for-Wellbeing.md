## The Foundational Fractal for Wellbeing

Wellbeing as used in this context, refers to constructing worldviews and adopting practices that allow the full flourishing of people, organizations, communities, wholesome social structures, and the natural (other than human/more than human) world around us.

Every person has a zone of optimal functioning where our skills, talents, and abilities are equal to the task before us and where work can be pleasurable and fulfilling. In the realm of the individual, proper diet, rest, exercise, emotional stability, nurturing relationships, confidence in your competencies, and a sense of purpose are necessary prerequisites for operating in your optimal zone.

In the realm of the interpersonal, people need to negotiate their boundaries and preferences in ways that produce harmonious relationships where the overarching goal is to develop work that contributes to the wellbeing of all four elements in the fractal. Put slightly differently, the objective is to bring out the best in each other while contributing to the wellbeing of the organization, society and the natural world.

In the system domain (which is usually referring to the organizational context) policies and procedures need to be designed and implemented that foster the wellbeing of the people in the organization, the wellbeing of the society in which the organization is situated, and that contributes to bringing about higher levels of wellbeing/flourishing for the larger world as well.

Until recently, most businesses and governments did not feel a need to address ecosystem concerns. The natural world was viewed as resources to be exploited and used freely to address human needs regardless of the impacts of human activities on those ecosystems.

Today, itâ€™s increasingly recognized that us-humans need to realign our activities to reclaim, restore, and regenerate the life support systems of our planet if we wish to remain a viable species.
