## Needed Narratives: Chess, Not Go Fish
by **Douglass Carmichael**

In many conversations that touch on climate issues, the discussion seems awkward. I've come to think that most people do not have a reasonable narrative about where we are in history, much less what's going on with the climate.

A good conversation is somewhat like a chess gameâ€“each participant should have a view of the board and the possible moves. Playing with someone who can only see two moves ahead is not fun to play with, much less have a conversation. Real conversations move like the horse.

An example of a weak but common conversation:

A: What do you think is causing climate change?
B: Burning fossil fuels.
A: Where?
B: In cars.
A: Anywhere else?
B: In trucks.
A: What might be a solution?
B: Clean energy.
A: What happens when we burn clean energy?
B: It goes into the air and is invisible.
A: Is that what we mean by clean?
B: Yes. I think so.

Such poorly developed minds cannot enter into the narrative without a lot of help.
