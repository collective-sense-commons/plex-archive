## Put All Your Attention on the Throughline
**Mark Dubois** and **Tom Atlee,** h/t **Charles Blass**

From Tom Atlee's blog: [Focusing on the Throughline – Random Communications from an Evolutionary Edge](https://www.tomatleeblog.com/archives/175328748)

To be a good boater means learning to read the river.  You must read the gargantuan hole that could eat you and your whole craft. You must read the shredder rock just under the surface that’ll rip things apart.  You’ve got to see those big obstacles as well as the little things.  If you miss the little rock just below the surface or the little eddy, they’ll spin you towards the big threats.The challenge of being a Class V boater is you have to SEE all of those – and then, put all your attention on the throughline where the current most cleanly flows.  The river always goes downstream.  So you focus on “Where’s the most benign path through the most powerful flow that I can stay aligned to?”If I obsess on the obstacles, they become magnets pulling me.  Despite their life threatening nature, I still need to focus my attention on the throughline. That is the challenge.
