## DayBalancer: Where Mission-Driven Professionals Find Compatible Opportunities
by **Jessie Upp**

[DayBalancer](https://daybalancer.com/) emerged from a simple truth: those who help others need support too. Founded by Jessie Upp in 2016, we’ve evolved from helping frontline workers prioritize self-care into a full-service talent solutions firm dedicated to collective impact by giving people resources to thrive, one person at a time.

**What we offer:** Our talent platform automatically connects professionals with compatible opportunities that support multiple income streams rather than just one job, where if it’s lost, families experience economic hardship.

We are flipping the traditional hiring model - instead of endless applications and self-promotion, compatible opportunities find you. We operate as a peer-to-peer circular talent network and partner with community leaders who want better ways to engage with their members by providing the value of a network that matches their members to compatible opportunities such as full-time/temp work, volunteering, pro bono experts, mentors, board members, partners, collaborators, and funding.

We give free network access for professionals seeking impact-driven work. For community leaders, we help increase member engagement by providing them with our system that combines the best of Indeed, LinkedIn, and eHarmony. For hiring managers, they can publish jobs and receive pre-qualified candidates for free, only paying a 15% fee on successful hires.

**What we’re working on right now:** We are exploring a cooperative business model and a community designed for peer support. For anyone who helped someone get paid work in the network, we want to send them referral income.

**What we’re looking for:** Connections with community leaders in climate tech, health innovation, and social impact who want to provide real professional value to their members.

**Our biggest win:** We’ve built a 250+ member talent pool, proving professionals want authentic connections over endless networking.

**Looking forward:** We’re exploring cooperative models to scale our proven approach and expand our network further. Success means 10,000 thriving mission-driven professionals by 2030.

**What keeps us motivated:** By helping each person thrive individually, we help our entire network thrive and access changes family trees. When talent connects based on true compatibility rather than polished resumes, we create generational impact.
