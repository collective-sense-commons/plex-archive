## Maps and Knowledge Sets
by **Wendy McLean**

Most recently I have been creating maps and knowledge sets, mostly working on pieces that have emerged from conversations inside Meta Project meetings, but also will ideally have applications elsewhere.  If you are curious or want to contribute, all are open to comments.

- The [Master Flow: Into the Better-Verse](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOq3BPYQ=/?share_link_id=251201915494) on Miro -  This map begins to show what is required to merge individual transformation with the technological and societal infrastructure necessary to sustain an elevated ecosystem. It’s an invitation to all of us to tell the story of how we create environments for thriving life. Open for collaboration.
- [Tech Features Document #1: Knowledge Network](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18R-C15Xp1GQ4zZTxCI_3M-d5eZ_kIxsC97EXCFf-5ZU/edit?usp=sharing) - This just emerged in the past few weeks, and is helping to identify what we have already “in the room” and what we need/want.  It’s currently in the exploration stage, with the intention to enable prioritization and development of key bridge pieces.  Likely it has deep connections to Free Jerry’s Brain discussions, which have not yet been included.  If you have any edits or suggestions, I’d love to hear from you.
- [Emerging Ideas](https://www.catalist.network/trove/1654541460329x424183238053330940?view=Card&filtered=yes) captured in a Trove - Curating a knowledge set of emerging connections in a collaborative way.  Here are the potential partnerships and useful resources specifically for Meta Project, held in this Trove on the Catalist Platform, to be referenced later when the timing is ‘right’.  See what’s already been curated and feel free to add an object if you like.  You can also sort by type, sector or topic and leave your comments or make a private note on objects already curated.  This is the beginning of collaborative knowledge curation.

If you want to learn more, I’m hosting a walkthrough and discussion on Tuesday, October 18th at 10am ET to discuss these further.  If you’re interested in attending, [please fill out this form](https://forms.gle/BAwE7TopDvriyL3Z8) with your basic info and I’ll send you a google calendar invite with the zoom link.  Much appreciated!
