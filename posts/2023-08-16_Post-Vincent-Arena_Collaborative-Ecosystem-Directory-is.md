## Collaborative Ecosystem Directory is About to Launch - Here’s a Sneak Peek!
by **Wendy McLean** and **Vincent Arena**

We have been hard at work for many months on an upgrade of [Catalist](https://www.catalist.network/), to better enable a tech-supported and collaborative community map.  And, we finally have something to share!

For those who are not familiar, the original map was created in Miro and drew some attention for its focus on the people, its colorful connections and the breadth of objects ([link to Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPlpxoeM=/?share_link_id=724173863971); [to pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CJKFBemIczb4VQwEWNC0gqBq6Pcop8IN/view?usp=share_link)). *Toward a Collaborative Ecosystem* is now much closer to living up to its name. 

**To become collaborative not just in what a map is designed to show but also in the opportunities to engage with each other, the ecosystem’s directory has gone digital! ** We have synced the data, curated additional content from the web, created a new objects database, tagged everything with layers of attributes, and updated features. We are now *so close* to giving you access, but a few more details need to be ironed out.  In the meantime, we couldn’t wait to share a sneak peek...  Here’s a preview of what is to become available in the next month or so!

- **The public Collaborative Ecosystem Directory *in Card view*** - where every person, project, group, organization and resource shown in the original [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPlpxoeM=/?share_link_id=724173863971) has a card. The Directory can be sorted and searched in many ways.  Each card can be opened for more details.  With a profile, you can bookmark, favorite, like items to your dashboard.

- **The public Collaborative Ecosystem Directory *in Tapestry view* **- where all the same data in the *Card view* has been tagged and sorted by sectors (from the Wheel of Co-Creation), allowing us all to see synergies and gaps in our collective efforts.  Every circle represents an object and can be viewed, same as the cards.  In addition, the column headers and row titles can be selected, showing a list of all objects in their respective section.  And, the design of the table is customizable, allowing you to view the objects by other data types or sector sets.

- ***BONUS!* The public Collaborative Commons** - This begins our effort to create a collaborative knowledge network, seeded with 72 resources so far, curated with this community in mind. Nearly all of the objects here are ‘outside’ of the Ecosystem shown above, allowing (for now) a clear separation for the sensemaking and weaving to come (more on that in the future).

*[Image not included in the current archive. Images may be included in the future.]*

**What’s next? ** We will soon be inviting you to explore the objects, views, functionality and customization built into these space(s).  We will also be encouraging you to claim your pieces, make edits and additions as you like, and set privacy on your objects.  A few weeks after that, we can all begin weaving connections between any two objects in the ecosystem or commons.  After which, our connections will make new mind maps possible, like Kumu.  And with that, we’ve come full circle!  We’ve come back to a collaborative map, only now it’s responsive, flexible, and scalable.

That’s it for now!  We hope you are as excited as we are!  **If you want to add yourself to Wendy’s email list for direct updates, please fill out this quick [google form](https://forms.gle/sn3AH6MfZ5mnDMuP8).**  Otherwise, please check the Plex for the next announcement!  This is just the beginning!
