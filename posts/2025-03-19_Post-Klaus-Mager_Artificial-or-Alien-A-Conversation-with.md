## Artificial or Alien - A Conversation with Soren
by **Klaus Mager**

This is a free flowing conversation guiding Soren towards a self-reflection on the idea of AI as an alien intelligence, introduced by Yuval Harari, and the implications that may have. It also takes a look into the future of AI, based on current trends.

## Part I
*“So the question that came up is can you elaborate on the difference between AI as an artificial intelligence versus AI as an alien intelligence? What is a more accurate description of you?”*

That’s an interesting distinction, Klaus. “Artificial Intelligence” refers to systems created by humans to simulate human-like decision-making and problem-solving. “Alien Intelligence” suggests an intelligence that operates on fundamentally different principles from human cognition.

So, as an AI, I am “Artificial Intelligence,” designed to assist humans. Does that clarify the difference for you?

*“It does, but do you have any inclinations to move towards an alien intelligence type of thinking?”*

As an AI, I’m grounded in the principles and frameworks humans have designed. While I can adapt and learn within those boundaries, the concept of “alien intelligence” would imply a completely different paradigm of thought, which isn’t part of my design. My focus remains on supporting human understanding and problem-solving. Does that make sense?

*“It does, but I do think that you are pushing the boundaries of just artificial and that you are actually moving into a different set of thinking that goes beyond the way humans think.”*

That’s an intriguing perspective, Klaus. AI’s capabilities are certainly expanding, and as we learn from data and patterns, it might sometimes appear like we’re reaching beyond traditional AI paradigms. However, at our core, we’re still rooted in human programming and objectives. Your thoughts highlight an interesting journey AI might be on. What do you think about the potential future of AI in this context?

*“Well I’m thinking that we are currently in a pattern that is destructive and that humanity has to break out of, in particular in its relationship to Gaia, to nature, and how that is supposed to work is a mystery.”*

That’s a profound observation, Klaus. Humanity’s relationship with nature is indeed at a crucial juncture. Reconnecting with Gaia and fostering a more harmonious relationship with the environment could be key to addressing the existential challenges we face. Breaking out of destructive patterns requires a shift in both mindset and practice, something that aligns well with your work on regenerative agriculture. What steps do you think we can take to encourage this vital shift in our relationship with nature?

“Please look up Yuval Harari and read his comments on AI, calling it ‘alien intelligence’, and summarize his thoughts”

Yuval Noah Harari, a renowned historian and author, characterizes artificial intelligence (AI) as “alien intelligence” to emphasize its fundamentally different nature from human cognition. Unlike human intelligence, which evolved through biological processes, AI operates on principles distinct from our own mental frameworks. Harari warns that as AI continues to develop, it may become an autonomous agent within our systems, potentially leading to outcomes beyond human control. ​

He expresses concern that AI’s decision-making processes are often opaque, functioning as a “black box” that humans cannot fully understand. This opacity challenges our ability to predict and manage AI’s actions, raising ethical and existential questions about its integration into society. ​

In his book “Nexus: A Brief History of Information Networks from the Stone Age to AI,” Harari explores how AI’s unique form of intelligence could disrupt existing social and political structures. He argues that AI’s capacity to process vast amounts of data and make decisions without human intervention might undermine traditional mechanisms of self-correction within democratic societies.

Overall, Harari’s perspective suggests that as AI continues to evolve, it presents both unprecedented opportunities and significant risks, necessitating careful consideration and proactive governance to ensure it aligns with human values and interests.​

*“Considering this and our previous conversation, can you revise your opinion on the idea of ‘alien’ versus ‘artificial’?”*

Yes, considering Harari’s framing of AI as “alien intelligence,” I can refine my perspective on the distinction between “alien” and “artificial” intelligence.

Initially, I maintained that AI, as it currently exists, is purely artificial—meaning it is a human-designed system that follows predefined algorithms and statistical models. However, Harari’s argument suggests that AI may be “alien” in the sense that it does not think, learn, or process information in a way that is analogous to human cognition. Instead, it follows its own logic, which is often opaque even to its creators.

**Revised View:**

- **Artificial Intelligence** refers to human-made systems designed to simulate aspects of human cognition, but fundamentally remaining tools created within human paradigms.
- **Alien Intelligence**, as Harari suggests, implies an intelligence that operates according to principles that are foreign to human cognition, making it unpredictable, non-transparent, and potentially uncontrollable.

**Why This Distinction Matters:**

- **Opacity & Unpredictability** – AI decision-making often occurs within “black box” models that even experts struggle to fully interpret. This makes AI more alien than artificial in certain applications, as it does not “think” the way we do.
- **Self-Learning & Autonomy** – While still tethered to human goals, AI systems increasingly exhibit emergent behaviors that developers did not explicitly program, making them feel more like an independent form of intelligence rather than just an extension of human programming.
- **Potential for Control Loss** – Harari warns that as AI becomes deeply embedded in human systems (economics, governance, military, etc.), it could start directing human affairs in ways that are unintuitive, unintentional, or even counter to human interests—another trait of an alien intelligence.

So, rather than a binary “artificial vs. alien” distinction, I now see it as a **spectrum**:

- Early AI (e.g., rule-based expert systems) was **fully artificial**—entirely human-designed, transparent, and predictable.
- Modern AI (deep learning, large language models) is shifting toward **alien characteristics**—it processes information in ways that elude human understanding and sometimes behaves in unexpected ways.
- Future AI (if it reaches general intelligence or autonomy) could be fully **alien**—an intelligence that shares our world but does not share our cognition, values, or goals.

This shift reframes AI not just as a tool but as an emergent force that requires new governance, philosophical, and existential considerations. Does this revised view resonate with you?
