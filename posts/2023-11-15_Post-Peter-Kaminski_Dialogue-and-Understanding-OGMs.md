## Dialogue and Understanding: OGM’s Heartfelt Discussion on Gaza
by **Peter Kaminski**

At [last Thursday’s Open Global Mind call](https://bra.in/7jMkxP), participants had an intense and heartfelt discussion about the situation in Gaza. The group, which included people with personal ties to the Middle East, shared personal stories and perspectives.

The discussion ranged over the conflict’s complexities, the effects of generational trauma, and the influence of religious and political extremism. Participants brainstormed ideas for peace, stressing the need to heal from past traumas and calling for empathetic, cooperative ways to solve conflicts. The call highlighted the importance of open and honest dialogue in understanding and addressing challenging and nuanced global issues.

Here are links to the recording and transcript of the call:

I prepared a customized version of ChatGPT, a “GPT” in OpenAI’s parlance, which has the transcript of the call as its “knowledge.” If you are a ChatGPT Plus subscriber, you can chat with the GPT at this unlisted link: [OGM Thursday, 2023-11-09](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-IeieiJhss-ogm-thursday-2023-11-09).

If you are not a ChatGPT Plus subscriber, you might be interested to watch a 22-minute demo video here: [A GPT for OGM Thursday, 2023-11-09 - the situation in Gaza](https://youtu.be/oRWnfLagdgU?si=Mo2tVgstJzHY5vsf&t=87).

The demo video is meant as an overview of both the call and the new “GPT” technology from OpenAI.
