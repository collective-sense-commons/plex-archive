## ‘Act Local’ School Takes Action
by **Kevin Jones**

A 10-year-old, well-regarded Black-led urban farm in a food desert has come under attack from the housing authority, which owns the land; they want to demolish it to create a playground. They have not talked to the community or the board.

We had a leader of the farm speak to our **Act Local School **and five people have taken action, writing letters, submitting petitions, and using their influence with city officials.

The hearing is on the 24th. This unites environmentalists and social justice folks.
