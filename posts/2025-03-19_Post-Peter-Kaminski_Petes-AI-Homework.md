## Pete’s AI Homework
by **Peter Kaminski**

If you’re not doing the AI thing yet, a suggestion:

Spend 7 hours (well, 6⅔ hours, at least) with LLMs, really using them. It'll probably feel hard, stupid, or strange to get started and keep going. But my observation is that it's hard to even know what these new tools are unless you've spent 5-10 hours with them.

Arrange it like this:

- 20 minutes a day (doesn't have to be contiguous, it's actually better if it's not).
- 5 days a week (take 2 days off to rest and integrate).
- 4 weeks, for a total of 400 minutes = 6⅔ hours.
- Use web and phone apps.
- LLMs mostly, AI images as desired.
