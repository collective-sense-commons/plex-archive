## Tweaking Regulations Creatively
by **Kevin Jones**

We are trying an end around on the rights of the river.

While working on an amendment to the town charter to make pollution illegal, rather than allowed within limits, as current regulations do, we are also looking to add biodiversity to the environmental assessment of a new riparian dorm project, so that they could not degrade biodiversity, which does the same thing as making pollution illegal.

A lot of time you can do more by tweaking regulations creatively and avoiding the limelight of legislation.
