## SenseDoing: Call for Participants
by the **SenseDoing team**

**Bentley Davis** and **Jerry Michalski** continue to structure the **SenseDoing** group, with a good call earlier this week, working on how the group might organize itself and its activities.

The current proposed structure:

Regularly scheduled opportunities to come together and experiment using a wide variety of sense making practices and tools. Each experiment will probably average 4 meetings, then we will switch topics, tools and practices.You can read more at the living [SenseDoing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MVqI8M_n925Fo5WYe07I1-auA4peqstZSWx6EmQ_Dps/edit#) document, and watch the recording of the call, [Figuring out what we mean by "SenseDoing" 2023-01-30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY32XHbeU4I).

The next meeting is on Monday, 6 February 2023, at 12:30pm CT (10:30am PT, 1:30pm ET, 6:30pm UTC). Here is the [Zoom link](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/89720336557?pwd=YXh0UjUvUlFIbzVDcE9ySVdZelRadz09).
