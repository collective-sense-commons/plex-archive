Gil is also working on **Critical Path Capital,** standing up a holding company to acquire, transform, and transition micro/small-cap companies into ecologically-grounded, employee-owned, community-rooted businesses. (Think of it as “the picks and shovels of the next economy.™”)

Also for financial analysts/designers. Also operating executives. Also seed investors (with right of refusal on subsequent.)
