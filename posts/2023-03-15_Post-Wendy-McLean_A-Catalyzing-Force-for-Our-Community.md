## A Catalyzing Force for Our Community
by **Wendy McLean**

*[Image not included in the current archive. Images may be included in the future.]*

My two most recent projects have now combined into one with the intention of being a **catalyzing force for our community**.

The first is a relaunch of the [Everyone’s Wisdom](https://www.everyoneswisdom.com/) website, designed to serve as a repository for the important concepts around effective collaboration. This site is still evolving. So far, I've been working alone to  add my own artifacts and to create a framework for all the pieces. Now it is ready for your contributions! I invite your exploration and welcome additional resources, discussions, projects, or collaborations. What do you think is most important here for our community?  What do you think is missing?  What could you add?  Please [contact me](mailto:wendy@everyoneswisdom.com) with any thoughts.

The other is an Ecosystem Map on Miro, called [Toward a Collaborative Ecosystem](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVPlpxoeM=/?share_link_id=149420567606&ref=biweekly-plex-dispatch), now also available from the [Everyone’s Wisdom website](https://www.everyoneswisdom.com/). Non-interactive, regularly updated snapshots in PDF format are available at this link: [Toward a Collaborative Ecosystem - Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CJKFBemIczb4VQwEWNC0gqBq6Pcop8IN/view?usp=share_link).

It’s an effort to illuminate existing synergies among the people and projects and to represent the organizations, networks and tools that could collectively be of service to all our efforts.  This map is just a beginning.  Currently it is from the perspective of myself and 10 other people who have collaborated on it, so it certainly doesn’t contain all possible connections. And yet, it has already begun to galvanize and generate momentum toward more collaborative efforts.  What do you get from it?

Please note, both are a work in progress. While both are available for sharing, both will also continue to evolve and be open to collaboration.  I invite you to explore and reach out to me with any insights that are in service to you and/or the whole at [wendy@everyoneswisdom.com](mailto:wendy@everyoneswisdom.com).

Next up:  Working in collaboration with **Vincent Arena** and his brilliance on **[Catalist](https://catalist.network/)**, we are even closer to scaling these resourcing and mapping efforts inside the Trove feature. Soon we are hoping to enable the curators and mappers among us to benefit from and collaborate on a shared repository.  More on this to come!
