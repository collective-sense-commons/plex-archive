## Program Chair, 2024 SIGGRAPH
Interview with **Julian Gómez**

Pete: Julian, I hear you’ve been appointed a program chair for the SIGGRAPH 2024 conference. *Congratulations!* What area will you be focusing on?

Julian: My area will be retrospective/futurespective, covering the past and future history of computer graphics. It will be based on established KM methodologies as well as state-of-the-art XR.

Pete: KM = knowledge management, and XR = Augmented Reality / Virtual Reality / Mixed Reality, right?

Julian: Yes, and also haptics and body sensors and whatever else comes along that fits into the general areas of visualization and sensing.

Pete: When/where will SIGGRAPH 2024 be?

Julian: Location hasn’t been announced yet. The site selection committee is still narrowing it down.

Pete: What impact will you being program chair have on the conference? What does the job entail?

Julian: These aren't really defined yet. My chats with the conference chair were along the lines of him giving me free reins to run rampant. One underlying factor is that I intend for it to be an interdisciplinary program, unlike the other programs which have well defined domains. I won't have any previous activity to look back to either, as this is a new position within the SIGGRAPH conference. Unlike the technical program, which is refereed, it’s a curated program like the art exhibition. But with my academic background, I’m going to insist on scholarship in the submissions. I'll be putting a lot more thought into it over the next few months as program chair vision statements are due in April.

Pete: Are there any connections between your SIGGRAPH work and FJB, OGM, other parts of the Plex?

Julian: Oh definitely. For years I’ve been pushing using graph databases to tell history, i.e. purpose directed knowledgebases. FJB and OGM I consider to be more general knowledgebases. But I also think that the only way to reasonably manage knowledgebases is XR, so whatever knowledge is developed going into to SIGGRAPH will percolate into FJB and OGM work.

Pete: What top things should we all know about the past and future history of computer graphics?

Julian: It’s pervasive in modern life. Pretty much all media uses CGI. Training and simulation have been revolutionized. It's also made its way into operations, as in factory operations and surgical operations. These happened because of the normal progression in engineering of smaller, faster, cheaper electronics. I intend to use leading edge computer graphics to tell the story of computer graphics. I'm describing the architecture as one which tells the story of the last 50 years and will tell the story of the next 50 years.

Pete: Thank you, Julian, and congratulations again!
