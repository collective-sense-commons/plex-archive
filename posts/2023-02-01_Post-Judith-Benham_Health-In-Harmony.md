## Health In Harmony
by **Judith Benham**

Iâ€™m sharing a communication from **[Health in Harmony](https://healthinharmony.org/)**, a group I support, working on climate change and helping people, led by physicians & scientists. I wish we had more groups as wholesome & heartfelt.

Preview below. See the **[Health In Harmony newsletter on the web](https://go.healthinharmony.org/webmail/978683/1283426347/8fa0f3ff7ea2b29c8cd6f8e7109c6d5deb672a1c705a87d2360f55a0f251a2a3)**.
