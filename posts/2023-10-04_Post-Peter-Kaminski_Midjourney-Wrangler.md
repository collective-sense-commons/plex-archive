## Midjourney Wrangler
by **Peter Kaminski**

As some of you know, I've been doing a deep dive into generative AI, particularly [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) of late. I'll share more information in the next Plex about online courses and newsletters I've been working on with **Wendy Elford** and **Mathew Lowry.**

Before then, I wanted to share a post I wrote for a friend who had asked what I found so fascinating about Midjourney images: [Midjourney Wrangler â€“ A Day in the Life](__GHOST_URL__/p/eae7d986-2952-49e3-8499-96407d3fbf41/). There are 160+ images, in groups of four, in the post.
