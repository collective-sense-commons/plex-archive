## *Living Between Worlds* Fourth Season
by **Gil Friend**

"New worlds don't just happen. We speak them into being…”

***Living Between Worlds** *returns for its fourth season Wednesday January 18 (from 12p-130p PT) and every third Wednesday thereafter.

In these monthly calls, cohosted by **Gil Friend** and **Ken Homer,** we explore the challenges of navigating the world of messes we've inherited and built—from climate and Covid to biodiversity and fascism to identity and pluralism—with grace, dignity, and power.

[You must pre-register to attend.](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIvf-mvrD8qGNUBS287pVRGQr77bUBhKQF4)
