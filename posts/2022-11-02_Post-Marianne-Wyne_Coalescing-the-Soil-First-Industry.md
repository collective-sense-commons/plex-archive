## Coalescing the Soil-First Industry
by **Marianne** and **Holly** for **Planetary CARE**

**Planetary CARE** is a collaborative commons that is coalescing the fractioned soil-first industry into a global movement.

We are moving into our fundraising phase to build global and regional soil first food networks across the food value chain

We will bring these communities together to provide access to valuable education, training, capital, and proven solutions. Providing access to rapidly advancing technologies – IoT, platforms, Web 3.0, virtual twins, etc. – is also critical for the soil-first enterprises in these communities to advance in an exponential fashion.

In parallel, we have been partnering with farmers to submit grants including for the recently announced USDA $2.8 billion to launch the carbon smart agriculture industry.  And we have been sending team members and providing scholarships to attend **Radical Transformational Leadership** training as we integrate proven systems thinking frameworks into our approach.

To learn more about our efforts and how to connect and support us please visit us at [Planetary CARE](https://planetarycare.org/), or email us at [contact@planetarycare.org](mailto:contact@planetarycare.org).
