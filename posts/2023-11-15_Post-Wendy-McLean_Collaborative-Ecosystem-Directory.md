## Collaborative Ecosystem Directory
by **Wendy McLean**

The **Collaborative Ecosystem** map is now officially in beta on [Catalist.Network](https://www.catalist.network/)! Over 250 interconnected objects now make it much easier to see the people and projects in our community.

I’ve created [this page on my site](https://www.everyoneswisdom.com/the-ecosystem) as a home for the project’s evolution, which includes an embed of the directory and also [this demo](https://youtu.be/FuxdUvKIi0o?si=bt9BVH5GX8zcQoqM) to show you the history of this mapping project and the Catalist features and capabilities that make the directory collaborative.

A huge thanks to Vincent for his continued partnership on this project and for his development of Catalist for the benefit of the Commons.  And another thank you to all the collaborators who assisted with contributing information to this mapping project.

As always, I’m open to your comments, suggestions and insights.  Feel free to email me at [wendy@everyoneswisdom.com](mailto:wendy@everyoneswisdom.com).
