## Prose Fusion
by **Peter Kaminski**

The “Markdown and Git for Collaborative Writing” sessions have evolved into [Prose Fusion](http://prosefusion.cloud/). Prose Fusion is a project team exploring and documenting how to do high-performance, team-based, collaborative writing. To aid our human coordination, we use tools like Markdown, Git, chat, and project management.

We have a chat channel on CSC Mattermost (free registration required): [https://chat.collectivesensecommons.org/agora/channels/prose-fusion](Prose Fusion is a project team exploring and documenting how to do high-performance, team-based, collaborative writing.
