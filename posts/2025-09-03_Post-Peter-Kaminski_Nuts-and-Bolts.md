## Nuts and Bolts
by **Peter Kaminski**

Following on from **Cabbages and Kings** above, here are some details about shutting down CSC Mattermost and Plex.

### Plex and CSC Mattermost Community Call
If you’re interested in joining a Zoom call in the next month to chat with friends and discuss next steps, add your name here:

[Stay Informed: Plex & CSC Mattermost Zoom Call](https://forms.gle/b5M5oxcD7LiARZ5X8)

I’ll email you a scheduling poll and date/time of call(s).

### Plex
- If you are a paid subscriber, **thank you!** Your support has helped me immensely in continuing to publish the Plex. My plan is to stop your paid subscription, and give you a pro-rated refund. If you have any questions or concerns, I want to hear from you, email me at [kaminski@istori.com](mailto:kaminski@istori.com).
- At some point, I’ll convert Plex from a live Ghost blog to a static HTML website. All the URLs and content will be the same. The web styling may change. I have hopes to repurpose the content as well; making individual posts from each issue, making an easy-to-download archive, making it easy to use AI to sift through the issues, etc.

### Mattermost
- I’ll make sure all the non-private channels get exported, and private channels where I can do so while respecting privacy considerations.
- Email me with any other questions or concerns: [kaminski@istori.com](mailto:kaminski@istori.com).

Chat/messaging services where you’ll still be able to find me: Signal, Discord, Matrix, Bluesky, Mastodon. And maybe Nostr. :)
