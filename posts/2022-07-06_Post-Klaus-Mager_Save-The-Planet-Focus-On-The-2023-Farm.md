## Save The Planet: Focus On The 2023 Farm Bill
Our fellow Plexian **Klaus Mager** and friends have conjured something powerful, important, and wonderful, a kickoff webinar to focus on the **2023 [US Farm Bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_farm_bill)**, with the goal of bending it towards improved soil health, repaired watersheds, and clean water. Doing all that will also help with climate change, although certain parties don't care and don't want to know about that.

Thursday, 28th July 2022
7 pm Eastern, 6 pm Central, 5 pm Mountain, 4pm Pacific

A little more information, from a draft press release (marketing materials are still coming together):

**The Connection of Soil Health and Water - Farm Bill 2023**
*A conversation with farmers, USDA and the Soil and Water Conservation District*

The [Farm Bill](https://www.usda.gov/farmbill) in size, scope, and complexity only compares to the US national defense bill. Congress deals with the renewal and revision of the comprehensive omnibus bill every five years, next in 2023. The Farm Bill impacts everything we eat and drink, our water, air, soil, and natural resources. It also profoundly impacts the lives and well being of our farmers.

For this webinar focused on soil and water, we have invited a panel of commodity crop farmers and senior level officials from USDA and the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau. 

In the discussion our expert farmers will explain what they need in terms of support and funding to repair and protect watersheds, pollinators, biodiversity, and increase carbon levels in the soil. 

The USDA and Soil and Water Bureau representatives then explain which programs embedded in the Conservation section of the farm bill apply for such purposes. 

With each 1% increase in carbon, the soil can hold an additional 20,000 gls of water, replenishing aquifers, streams and the local water cycle.

Please [REGISTER HERE](https://bit.ly/farmbillandcleanwater) to join the conversation; we will send video and follow up materials after the event. 

For the 2023 Farm Bill, funding will need to be reallocated to compensate and incentivize farmers to shift into regenerative practices. It will be important to know and understand the Farm Bill in some detail.
