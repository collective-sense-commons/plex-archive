## Massive Wiki Turning 2
by **Peter Kaminski**

The first version of the **massive.wiki** website was published in February 2021. That means that Massive Wiki is coming up on its second anniversary this month!

We have a small celebratory release, a completely refreshed and updated [massive.wiki](https://massive.wiki/) website. A couple of the best pages:

- [Get Started with Massive Wiki](https://massive.wiki/Get_Started_with_Massive_Wiki.html)
- [Massive Wiki in Action](https://massive.wiki/Massive_Wiki_in_Action.html)

Also, please join us every Wednesday at 12:00pm ET, 9am PT for **Massive Wiki Wednesday** on zoom: [https://us02web.zoom.us/j/84876942036?pwd=amVrWVBmRW45RDBoTGE0bmFIQzFKUT09](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/84876942036?pwd=amVrWVBmRW45RDBoTGE0bmFIQzFKUT09)
