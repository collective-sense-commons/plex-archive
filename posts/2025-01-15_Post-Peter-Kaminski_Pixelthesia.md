## Pixelthesia
by **Peter Kaminski**

Last year, some of you subscribed to my paid newsletter of generative AI images that I prompted and curated. (Prompting is easy, curation is hard.) 100 issues, each with nine beautiful images for aesthetic contemplation.

I have a new name and a renewed focus for this year's images. **Pixelthesia** is where I curate and share generative AI images. I aim to share beautiful and unique pieces that spark joy.

Growing up in the 60s / 70s, one of my favorite things was looking through the glossy photos in Life / Look / National Geographic magazines, vicariously exploring worlds I might never visit myself, through the eyes of expert photographers. That's always the feeling I'm trying to rekindle with my best Pixelthesia images.

Do me a favor? Explore my [Pixelthesia Bluesky feed](https://bsky.app/profile/pixelthesia.ai) (you don't need a Bluesky account), and if your interest is piqued, follow me there or subscribe to my free newsletter at [pixelthesia.ai](https://pixelthesia.ai/).

Thanks for your consideration, even if you don't end up following. ðŸ˜Š
