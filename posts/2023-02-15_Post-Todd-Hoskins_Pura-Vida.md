## Pura Vida!
by **Todd Hoskins**

I’m writing to you in this triennial cycle from a hammock in Guanacaste, Costa Rica. For now, this is home–two kilometers from the Pacific in tropical dry forest that has been restored over the last three decades.

My beloved, Pia, and I decided to move here last summer. The youngest child, Leo, decided he was leaving the country for culinary school. He went north, and we went south. It took us a few months to prepare, but now we’ve been here near Paraiso (Paradise) for nearly two months. We are driving dirt roads with a 1997 Nissan Pathfinder, doing phone and Zoom calls from our front porch, eating A LOT of fresh fruit, and waking to the sounds of Howler Monkeys.

We love the culture and the pace here. The critical infrastructure (water, food, broadband, electricity, healthcare) is great. The roads are not, but I’m beginning to think there may be wisdom in not prioritizing roads. Walking, horse riding, and difficult driving keep life more local, and definitely less commercialized. 

We live on the edge of the jungle, and yet have fiber internet to the home. Digital and health equity are taken seriously here. It’s just a few of the reasons we made the leap. You can read some periodic updates about our adventures from Pia at [Letters from Costa Rica](https://www.lettersfromcostarica.com/). I'll send more updates to the Plex as I have them.
