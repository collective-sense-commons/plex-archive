## Everyone's Wisdom Becoming a Navigation Portal
by **Wendy McLean**

*[Image not included in the current archive. Images may be included in the future.]*

[**Everyone's Wisdom**](https://www.everyoneswisdom.com/) website is getting an overhaul and major upgrade!  It's now clear that our ecosystem has enough viable pieces to create a picture of what we have and what we can build.  The site aims to highlight the major pieces and put them together so the entire ecosystem can begin to take shape, conceptually at least.

Ultimately, and hopefully in a relatively short time, Everyone's Wisdom will evolve into a navigation portal.  In partnership with **Vincent Arena** and the [Catalist Network](https://www.catalist.network/), it will guide people to the next right step for them personally, in their work, for their network or in alignment with their aspirations.

Stay tuned!  And if you're interested in collaborating on this effort, reach out to Wendy McLean - [wendy@everyoneswisdom.com](mailto:wendy@everyoneswisdom.com)
