## Turn of the Phase: Wisdom Jam Afterflow with Ward Cunningham + Potpourri ‘23
by **charles blass**

HNY & goodness to all <3

a few things, potpourri upon the turn of the phase:

excited to share [**Part 2 (aka Afterflow) of the Wisdom Gardening Jam**](https://youtu.be/ktzo62x5jKw) (November 1st), now up, featuring extended forays with [**Ward Cunningham**](https://www.zentao.pm/blog/a-brief-history-of-agile-ward-cunningham-the-inspiration-behind-wiki-1183.html) and friends from Kernel & the Cicosphere (more context in November’s [Plex CoDebrief](__GHOST_URL__/2022-11-16/)), yielded deep insights into [**Doug Engelbart**](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/douglas-engelbart-invented-future-180967498/) & early days of networked computing, **roots and future of Wiki**, ***indigenous protocols***, and more

[**Musings on the passage of time**](https://youtu.be/7BH6XCRZad8) included this New Year’s Day message from [**Gien Wong**](http://stopresetgo.org/) in the [**CICOLAB** Telegram channel](https://t.me/+XqX5LzYLGwtkNWM8):
*“Today the calendar rolls over to a new year! Yet, at the same time, it has only advanced another day. And at the same time, have we ever left the present moment? We can't change ourselves, the conditions of our lives or of the world overnight, but we can take the opportunity to reflect on the period of 365 days that have just passed us by, take stock, and reflect on what we can do to make our next moments alive more meaning-full, more joy-full, more wonder-full, more beauty-full, more peace-full, more bliss-full. For we are the architects of our future, and our imagination is our greatest tool.”*

(my response)
*“every day the pages flip…. time to take stock of our calendars…!*
*which ones are useful, meaningful, when/where/how ?!*
*and why, how do we consider the sources and*
*purposes of such structures, institutions ?”*

updates & invitations en route from [**Noonet**](https://nao.is), as we start to organize a **Consortium for Portable Communities**….
