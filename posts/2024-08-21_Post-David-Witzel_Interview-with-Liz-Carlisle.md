## Interview with Liz Carlisle
by **David Witzel**

I wanted to let Plex readers know that Ken, Klaus and I hosted a session with Liz Carlisle on her new book, **Healing Grounds - Climate, Justice, and the Deep Roots of Regenerative Farming**.

In **Healing Grounds,** Carlisle shares stories of Indigenous, Black, Latinx, and Asian American farmers who are reviving their ancestors’ methods of growing food—techniques long suppressed by the industrial food system. These farmers are restoring native prairies, nurturing beneficial fungi, and enriching soil health. While feeding their communities and revitalizing cultural ties to land, they are steadily stitching ecosystems back together and repairing the natural carbon cycle. This, Carlisle shows, is the true regenerative agriculture – not merely a set of technical tricks for storing CO2 in the ground, but a holistic approach that values diversity in both plants and people.

The 1-½ hour  hour session was co-hosted by David Witzel, Global Regeneration CoLab; Ken Homer, Collaborative Conversations; and Klaus Mager, Food With Thought.
