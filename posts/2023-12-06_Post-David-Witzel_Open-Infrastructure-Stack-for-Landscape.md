## Open Infrastructure Stack for Landscape Regeneration
by **David Witzel**

I would love your feedback on a concept document -- [Creating an Open Infrastructure Stack for Landscape Regeneration: A Realization of Hope](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hCGwmrVUjxYSkl9SOx_giB9hnYhJJ2y4TW4c9rHJNBo/edit?usp=sharing).

The notion was inspired by Dorn Cox’s book “[The Great Regeneration: Ecological Agriculture, Open-Source Technology, and a Radical Vision of Hope](https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/the-great-regeneration/)”. It posits that open sourcing will help make abundant knowledge and processes that will help accelerate a regenerative future.

The big question is how to activate a self-sustaining business model that will create and improve the open assets.

You are welcome to join [a zoom session on 12/8 at 9am PST / noon EST](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/86902669124?pwd=TnRsUW5GdUlDeHhBR1BjWkJPcVgxUT09) to present and discuss the concept.
