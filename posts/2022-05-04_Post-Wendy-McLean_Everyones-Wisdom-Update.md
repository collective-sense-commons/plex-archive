## Everyone's Wisdom Update
**Wendy McLean** is increasingly focusing on **how we as humans can better create environments for emergence;** how we can apply what we've learned and how we can learn from what has been applied.

She's currently curating and expressing information on this topic on the [Everyone's Wisdom website](http://www.everyoneswisdom.com/emergence), specifically with a recent post called “[Finally](https://www.everyoneswisdom.com/post/finally)” and a Miro board called the [Cycle of Emergence](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOCAoMLI=/?share_link_id=779619708299) which is open for all to comment.  She welcomes your feedback, and especially any suggestions on research or missing pieces she should consider.  If this is an area where you like to play, please reach out to her at [wendy@everyoneswisdom.com](mailto:wendy@everyoneswisdom.com). Blessings!
