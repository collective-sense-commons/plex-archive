## SIGGRAPH*’*s 50th: A Rather Spectacular Gallery
by **Julian Gómez**

This year is the [50th SIGGRAPH conference](https://s2023.siggraph.org/), and over the last year there’s been quite a lot of activity in finding artifacts covering that 50 year history, which will be displayed at the conference.

Part of the exhibition will be a timeline with 3D graphics projected on a 20’×50’ wall showing accomplishments over each of those years in different categories.

Being an old fart who’s been around for almost all of those years I've been contributing quite a bit to the multiple history efforts. It looks like it's going to be a rather spectacular gallery.

As of now there’s one publicly accessible journal:

[The Big 50: Celebrating 50 ACM SIGGRAPH Conferences](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10123378) (PDF, 22.6Mb)

Con: The exhibition is behind an old-fashioned paywall, i.e. you need a ticket to see it.

Pro: There*’*s been some talk about touring the exhibition. Most likely this won’t be seriously addressed until after the resting period after the conference.
