## Header Image: Use of Food for Biofuel and Animal Feed
The header image for this issue comes from **Our World in Data's** Agricultural Production section, via **Klaus Mager**. An interactive version of the chart is available at [Share of cereals allocated to food, animal feed or fuel](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cereal-allocation-by-country)**.**

Klaus wrote [on the Open Global Mind mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/openglobalmind/c/SUWn6snNhhM/m/LB6ajdSBAgAJ):

With the loss of the Ukraine as one of the major global supplier of commodity crops, a realignment will be necessary. This chart explains some options.The obvious solution would be to reduce the use of food for biofuel and animal feed. Instead the energy is going into opening up more marginal land to grow more chemical intensive GMO crops that destroy the soil.Just saying.
