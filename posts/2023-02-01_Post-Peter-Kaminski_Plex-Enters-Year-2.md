## Plex Enters Year 2!
by **Peter Kaminski**

Time flies, and I can't quite believe it, but this is issue #25, the first issue of the second year of Plex.** ðŸŽ‰**

The inaugural issue was published on 2 February 2022: [2/2/22 First BPD!](__GHOST_URL__/2022-02-02/) It's a blast to look back; much is different in the world, and much is the same.

Thank you, dear readers, for the warm reception you have give the **Biweekly Plex Dispatch,** and for everybody's contributions.

***And special thanks to paid subscribers*â€“**I greatly appreciate your vote of confidence and continued support, plunking down real money! It means a lot to me. ðŸ™‚

*BPD Editor and Publisher,
Pete*
