## From Monocrop Farmers to Biodiversity Restorers
by **Chochi Iturralde**

*(Ed. note: Chochi visits with us by way of **Wendy Elford**)*

When I arrived in Mushullakta four years ago, I had a single mission in mind: to persuade local farmers to become biodiversity restorers. My success has gone beyond my expectations, but not for the reasons I initially thought would bring about the change. The magic came from elsewhere.

Mushullakta is one of hundreds of communities in the Amazon Rainforest of Ecuador; one of thousands if you count other Amazon countries. Like most of these communities, Mushullakta depended on natural resource extraction for their survival. Timber, mining, monocropping, and cattle raising are the only ways people can make an income in these remote areas, and our modern world has incentivized extraction for so long that it has become part of the people’s identity. It’s the sad story of “lack” they’ve heard others say about them for decades. It’s the story most communities tell themselves still.

That is until they hear a different story.

I didn’t see this at first, but like all humans, the people in Mushullakta longed for a sense of belonging and significance. They wanted to be seen, to be part of something bigger than themselves, but they couldn’t escape the oppressive system of social castes and economic injustice that was forced upon them centuries ago. So, naturally, when they were offered the opportunity to renounce that system and become important restorers of the ecosystems needed to sustain all life on Earth, they immediately felt a calling.

To my amazement, their new identity began to work its magic, immediately and permanently transforming their mindsets and behaviors. They became environmentally-conscious, proud entrepreneurs that were contributing to society by resurfacing and applying the knowledge passed down to them by their ancestors, the same knowledge that kept the rainforest alive for millennia. 

I thought the extra income would be the main driver of change, yet it was just an added bonus. More importantly, their added income felt like a fair exchange for offering essential services to the planet, not a donation to those who lack money.

This magic showed me that what drives change are stories of abundance and true partnerships, not money. This magic helped me see the simple and effective solution hidden in plain sight: if we give vulnerable communities the opportunity to take the lead on solving our environmental crisis, they can restore our planet’s biospheres much faster and without spending on expensive technology. A win-win like no other.
