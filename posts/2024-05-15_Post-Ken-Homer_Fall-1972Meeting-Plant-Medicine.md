## Fall 1972–Meeting Plant Medicine
by **Ken Homer**

I was 15 and hanging out with my friends
They all smoked pot but I wasn't ready yet
I'd been raised to be very afraid of drugs
the information I'd been fed told me
that l'd either become a hopeless addict
or lose my mind if I ever smoked pot
But l had been around my older sister
when she got high and I noticed that
when she got stoned she was nice to me
(An exceedingly rare occurrence that)
which made smoking it of interest to me

I lived in Brunswick Maine a stone's throw
from the Androscoggin River which back In
the '70s was terribly fouled by the S. D.
Warren paper company upstream from us
SDW discharged so much pollution that
the river water was brownish-black and a
sickly yellow foam floated on its surface
It coated anything it touched and was not
easily cleaned off when you got home
You wouldn't want to eat anything from
the Androscoggin in those days and it
made me sad to know that in earlier times
it was home to an abundance of aquatic
life that sustained the Indigenous tribes
and the native animals that lived
near its banks for countless centuries

Some days the water smelled so fetid
you didn't want to go near the river
Other days it wasn't too terrible
I was just glad we didn't live upstream

Brunswick lay on one side of the river
Topsham rose up on a hill on the other
A bridge downtown handled most traffic
Another nearer to me carried freight trains
the lower level could accommodate cars
but it was in disrepair with a 90° turn at one
end and I could hear cars driving over the
creaky boards at all hours of the day
The car level has since been removed

A pedestrian bridge also spanned the river
That bridge was designed and built by
none other than the John A. Roebling Co.
The same guy who built the Brooklyn Bridge
Everyone calls it: The Swinging Bridge
because it swings when the wind blows
which is disconcerting for many people
I knew people who refused to walk on it
My favorite time to use it was in the Spring
when winter's thaw would raise the level
of the Androscoggin to within inches of
the floor of the swinging bridge The winter
runoff meant the water was much cleaner
It was a rush to stand on that bridge with a
raging torrent just inches below your feet

I was walking that bridge in a thunderstorm
when one tower was struck by lightning
There was a blinding flash and a huge
crashing of thunder all around me
Blue-white shards of electricity danced on
the supporting cables on either side of me
The smell of ozone stung my nostrils
Every hair on my body stood on end
I seriously thought my life was about to end
But the tower had grounded the strike
The cables carried a non-lethal discharge
I touched no metal on the wooden floor
Shaken and stirred I lived to tell the tale

The banks on the Topsham side of the river
are gentler than on the Brunswick side
There's a small island just off shore near the
bridge we accessed it via a fallen tree and
some strategically located boulders being
Always careful not to step in the foul water
My friends and I used to haunt this island
We'd hang out by the water's edge where
we'd throw rocks smoke cigarettes and
practice being juvenile delinquents
(I'm sorry to say we were too good at it)

One of my friends was a minor dealer
He was good for nickel and dime bags
My friends would offer me pot but I refused
After numerous outings to the island one
day they finally convinced me to try it
I did and absolutely nothing happened
But they kept pressuring me and I kept at it
Much to my surprise one day it worked

I wasn't aware that I was high at first
I took a few hits and felt nothing
Then I wandered away from the group
and suddenly the world seemed to grow
both softer and sharper at the same time
Light and shadows took on greater depth
My breathing slowed as my mind shifted
My sense of being in a body expanded
My proprioception opened to a larger field
Inner and outer space seemed to blend
yet simultaneously became more distinct
Time felt as fluid as the water flowing by
Both sounds and colors were more vibrant
All my senses felt sharper and keener

I looked up at the trees around me
(An image I carry to this day)
Maine is famous for its tall pine trees
I was in a cluster of them and the sun
was shining down through their needles
It was as if warm fingers caressed my face
The sky appeared to be a deeper blue
than it had been just a few minutes before

The sound of the river rushing by washed
over me and washed through me
The way music does in a concert hall
The trees spoke to me of their rootedness
The sky offered me its vast spaciousness
With closed eyes I could feel with certainty
that the rocks under my feet were carrying
on a fascinating dialogue with my bones

All at once I laughed a big loud long laugh
A laugh that seemed to come up out
of the ground-direct from Gaia Herself
It rose up through me exploding into gales
of pure mirth as if l'd finally understood the
punchline to a rollicking good joke
I rejoined my friends who were all quite
delighted that I had finally managed to
catch a buzz Now do you see why we
smoke? I had to admit it was a lovely thing
and contrary to the myths I didn't become
an addict nor did llose my mind and
suddenly turn into a drooling idiot
That was my introduction to the magic of
plant medicine l've used that medicine in
both skillful and irresponsible ways over the
last 50+ years and l'm a better person for it

There've been some incredibly intense
periods of daily use and times where I
didn't touch it for years on end I've had
experiences both mundane and mind-
blowing and from speaking with others l've
learned that this plant medicine affects
people in a wide variety of ways

I do plant medicine less frequently these 
days and the delivery vehicle tends to be
edibles When I commune with plant
medicine I bring an attitude of reverence
to it I take time to thank it and ask it for
help I treat it as medicine not as an
escape (Which it was for many years)

I find I am nearly always rewarded with
an expanded sense of being alive Of
wonder and joy and awe at life It fills me
with good humor and contentment
A sense of harmony unites my body-mind
I feel and sense a different way of being
a different way of thinking and feeling
It helps me get my mind around problems
Insights stay with me and inform me
long after its effects fade away
I get a sense of deepened connection
to Gaia to my ancestors and a reminder
that my job is to be a good ancestor
to those who will walk the Earth after me
