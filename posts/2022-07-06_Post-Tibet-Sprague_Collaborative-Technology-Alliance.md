## Collaborative Technology Alliance Pledge v1.0
by **Tibet Sprague**

The **[Collaborative Technology Alliance](https://www.collaborative.tech/)** exists to facilitate collaboration among those building social technology in service to a thriving world. Today we take the next step in building our alliance with the launch of the [**Collaborative Technology Alliance Pledge**](https://dkejevlwldw.typeform.com/to/HOeA9PWJ)! Signing this pledge means committing to follow [these principles](https://www.collaborative.tech/principles) in your work of designing and building social platforms and tools. It is also the baseline agreement we ask you to commit to if you want to join the Alliance.

We know that releasing this **version 1.0 of the pledge** means we are going to get a bunch more feedback from the wider world, which is great. Please do let us know if there are major concerns/blockers that are preventing you from signing, and we are likely to do a fairly quick turnaround on a version 1.1. 

This pledge is just the next step for the CTA, there's much more to come! These principles are fairly general, and we will now build on top of them more detailed agreements, practices and projects that move us towards the long term vision of deep collaboration and interoperability across all aligned platforms.

One of the next projects that has the most energy right now is the idea of creating **Nutrition Labels** for social platforms/technologies, which would have much more detailed and concrete information about each platform and how they are living up to these principles (or not). Also soon to come is the process and invitation to step into more of a leadership/stewardship role for the Alliance, as we are looking for more stewards to join the core team!

For now, this pledge is a solid foundation to build on and a beacon to the rest of the world, to call in all the other collaborative technologists out there who want to join forces with us, so please spread around!

May all our collaborations be meaningful, impactful and joyful!
