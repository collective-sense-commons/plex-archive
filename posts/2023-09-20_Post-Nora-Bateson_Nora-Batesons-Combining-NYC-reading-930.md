Nora Bateson’s new book “Combining” is coming out in October! From the [Triarchy Press “Combining” page](https://www.triarchypress.net/combining.html):

In ***Combining*,** love, humor, curiosity, and vulnerability entwine amidst the trials of a world in flux. As we face the Polycrisis, Nora Bateson urges us to swerve from the traditional paths and to dismantle the illusions of fitting in. She beckons us to step into a world where learning, uncutness, and readiness converge, promising both revelation and revolution.There is a launch event on September 30 in NYC: [Combining: A Reading by Nora Bateson](https://nysgs.org/event-5402217).
