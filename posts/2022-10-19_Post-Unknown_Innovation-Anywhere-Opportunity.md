## Innovation Anywhere, Opportunity Everywhere
by **Judy Benham**

The thoughts reflected in this presentation by NSF Director Panchanathan, “[Innovation anywhere, opportunity everywhere: The trajectory of global collaboration](https://beta.nsf.gov/news/nsf-director-panchanathan-delivered-remarks-2022),” fit well with the vision of OGM.

The sharing of insights, knowledge, and innovation across the globe is critical to address the challenges we all face with environmental challenges, social divides, and political polarization.

The better we can communicate, share, and build on one another’s wisdom and knowledge, the more rapidly we can progress. Expanding education to underserved groups will enable more people to participate, create, and develop the solutions that are needed.
